        title: '2025 Could easily be Nintendos Year',
        excerpt: ' If you squinted, you could see a shadow that looked a little bit like Florida over 2025.',
        content: `<p>Naturally, that was the specter of GTA 6, which was originally scheduled to launch later this year but was moved to next year, on May 26, 2026.</p>
<p>The year could have been completely dominated by Rockstar's next epic, but the skies have cleared to let another giant release take 2025 as its own - the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<h2>Nintendo Switch 2</h2>

<p>Nintendo needs to make this first year of Switch 2 really matter if it wants to win in 2025. Even when you take into account major releases like Death Stranding 2, Elden Ring Nightreign, Borderlands 4, and, dare I say it, Hollow Knight: Silksong, Nintendo's new console is now the biggest launch of 2025 by quite a bit. However, with just one major launch game, the remainder of 2025 will need to be counted.</p>

<h2>Pole position</h2>


<p>Switch 2 is starting strong, launching hand-in-hand with potentially the best ever Mario Kart game yet in Mario Kart World on June 5. </p>

<p>Its introduction of open-world exploration, evolution of Grand Prix races, and brand new, brilliantly chaotic Knockout Tours means that it's going to be the game everyone is talking about and sharing across their social media in June. </p>

<p>If it's got the staying power that Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has had (it's still one of the best-selling games of all time and the best-selling Switch game), the Switch 2 is out the starting gate with a bang.
                       But then, before you know it, we're into July where Nintendo has already scheduled our second big release for Switch 2 in Donkey Kong: Bananza.  Despite the brain ache it gives me every time trying to get the Bananza spelling right, this is exciting territory for DK.</p>



<p>It's the first 3D Donkey Kong game for 26 years (the last being Donkey Kong 64 on the N64) and from what I've played at the Switch 2 preview event, it feels like DK being given the Super Mario Odyssey treatment, to the point that if you switched out the ape for our old plumber pal you could argue it's essentially Super Mario Odyssey 2 in all but name.</p>

<p>While DK's next outing isn't launching day one but on July 17, it is arriving in what we call the launch window for Switch 2, and provides an excellent excitement build just over a month after the console's debut.</p>

<p>That's two big exclusives within as many months for Switch 2.  And that's without even noting the big event that's happening between those two dates.</p>

<p>Summer Game Fest, the big June gaming industry event that's now emerged victorious from the remains of E3, is running from June 6 - 10, and usually Nintendo takes its usual slot on the Tuesday (this year being June 10) to drop a livestreamed Nintendo Direct.</p>

<p>It hasn't announced one yet for this year, but it's also not unlike Nintendo to drop such an event with 24-48 hours' notice.</p>


<h2>Closing The Year</h2>

<p>We have two major, undated Switch 2 exclusives that are due to launch in 2025 that may get release dates during an SGF presentation.  Knowing when Metroid Prime 4: Beyond and Pokemon Legends: Z-A will arrive for Nintendo Switch 2 will outline the agenda for the Switch 2's first year as - hopefully - continued critically-acclaimed exclusives.</p>

<p>There are also titles like Kirby Air Riders, Drag x Drive, and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment still to come in 2025 that are also currently dateless and exclusive to Switch 2.  Again, they're really bolstering this first year line-up for the Switch 2 and only aiding the idea that this year could well be dominated by Nintendo releases.</p>

<p>With GTA 6 now set to take over 2026, and with console exclusives for Xbox and PlayStation currently being a little scarce beyond the likes of The Outer Worlds 2 and Ghost of Yotei (at least so far), 2025 really is Nintendo's.</p>

<p>From the outline we have already for releases, it already feels like Switch 2 is the console to have in 2025.</p>

<p>If Nintendo can keep up with what it's already promised, it's going to be quite the first year for Switch 2.</p>`,

        title: 'Nintendo is  Switch 2 Here',
        excerpt: 'The Nintendo Switch 2 is real and its launching in June',
        content: `<p> After literally years of unverified rumors, dubious leaks and copious amounts of online speculation, Nintendo revealed its next-generation console, and it’s the Switch sequel the majority expected (and many of us wanted).</p>


<p>First announced back in January and then fully unveiled at the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct event in April along with 22 launch games, the Switch 2 is an evolution of the existing Nintendo Switch console rather than a reinvention of the wheel.</p>

<p>On the surface, the Nintendo Switch 2 looks largely identical to its predecessor, but there is one key difference: Switch 2 is bigger!
                 In the handheld world, bigger is increasingly meaning better, with chunky units like Steam Deck OLED ruling supreme, and Nintendo is following the trend.  Prepare your pockets because the Nintendo Switch 2 isn’t a slim device.</p>

<p>In the original Switch 2 reveal trailer, Nintendo cleverly showcased the Switch 2’s increased size by comparing it with the current Switch.  It will sport a larger display size and thinner bezels.</p>

<p>Another noticeable design tweak is the new kickstand.  It will cover the entire back of the console and is adjustable so you can view the display from multiple angles.  It’s a huge leap from the regular Switch’s restrictive (and flimsy) kickstand but comparable with the kickstand added to the Nintendo Switch OLED model in 2021.</p>


<p>One of the big Nintendo Switch 2 rumors was the addition of a mysterious “C button.”  Yesterday, a brief video was uploaded to the Nintendo Today app. But now, during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, Nintendo has officially unveiled this button, which works with the new GameChat feature.</p>

<p>The system's new chat system can be accessed by pressing the C button on the right joystick. The menu in question appears very similar to the one you’d see on Discord, with each player’s camera showing up as tiles on the screen.</p>


<p>Speaking of the Joy-Cons, Nintendo also showed off mouse-like controls for its controllers.  The control scheme mirrors how a PC mouse works, where you put both Joy-cons on a table or surface and roll them to control whatever is on the screen.</p>


<p> There are also elements of motion controls similar to what we've already seen on the original Nintendo Switch, where you can jerk your wrist with the controller in-hand to toss a ball, or something similar.</p>
<p>At a glance, there might not appear to be much new, but Switch 2’s Joy-Cons won’t just be bigger, but they will also connect to the console in a new way.  The railing system is out, and instead, a new connection method has been implemented.</p>


<p>The Switch 2’s reveal video showcases this change and the way the Joy-Cons snap onto the Switch 2’s main console unit sure does look satisfying.</p>

<p>In docked mode, the Switch 2 can hit up to 4K (3840 x 2160) resolution at 60 frames per second.  It also supports 120 fps when 1920x1080 or 2560x1440 resolutions are selected.  The system supports HDR10 and a 1920x1080 resolution in tabletop mode and handheld mode, following screen resolution.</p>

<p>The Switch 2 also ships with a redesigned dock.  The new dock features softer, rounded edges, and more of the display is visible when docked — whether this will be used for gameplay features remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Nintendo says the Switch 2 will have up to 6.5 hours of battery life, depending on what games you're playing.  The system will sport a pair of USB-C ports.</p>

<p>The original Nintendo Switch didn’t have the same voice chat functionality as the PS5 and Xbox Series X.  Because of that, the new GameChat feature is one of the most important features coming to Nintendo’s console.  Here’s how it works.
                           The GameChat overlay looks like the Discord chat overlay.  A small microphone on top of the console picks up your voice, even from a distance.</p>


<p>Nintendo says there’s noise canceling, so you won’t have to worry if you’re playing in a noisy environment.  And as seen in the video, it appears you can press the C button to mute yourself.  This works whether you’re in handheld or docked mode.</p>

<p>There are other functions similar to PS5.  You’ll be able to chat across different games, view another player’s screen, and share your screen.  You can even use the brand-new Nintendo Switch 2 camera while gaming. As expected, the Nintendo Switch 2 will support a slew of accessories.</p>


<p>Most notably, we were introduced to GameChat, Nintendo's new in-game chat system.  This incorporates the all-new peripheral, the Switch 2 Camera, which can add your friendly face to multiplayer sessions or even incorporate your image into select titles like Super Mario Party Jamboree.</p>



<p>Price info for all the new Nintendo Switch 2 accessories, including controllers, carry cases, and peripherals, has now been confirmed on the official Nintendo website.</p>

<p>You can find a full list below:</p>
<ul>
<li>strong>Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller: $79.99 ($10 more than the original Pro Controller RRP)</strong></li>
<li>strong>Joy-Con 2 controllers: $89.99 ($10 more than original Joy-Con pairs)</strong></li>
<li>strong>Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip: $34.99</strong></li>
<li>strong>Joy-Con 2 Strap: $12.99</strong></li>
<li>strong>Joy-Con 2 Wheel (set of two): $19.99</strong></li>
<li>strong>Nintendo Switch 2 Camera: $49.99</strong></li>

<li>strong>Nintendo Switch 2 All-in-One Carry Case: $79</strong></li>
<li>strong>Nintendo Switch 2 AC Adapter: $29 (same as original Switch)</strong></li>
<ul>

<p>Overall, the new peripherals aren't much more expensive than they already were.</p>

<p>While the system might appear similar to its predecessor, its strength lies in its refinement and an impressive assortment of first and third-party games.</p>

<p>Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders will begin on Wednesday, April 9 in the US.  The standalone Nintendo Switch 2 console will cost $449 / AU$699 / £395. </p>

<p>Alternatively, there will be a Switch 2 bundle that includes a digital copy of Mario Kart World for $499 / AU$769 / £429.  The Nintendo Switch 2 will be widely available starting June 5th.</p>

<p>In the U.S., retailers such as Amazon and Best Buy are already sold out of pre-orders but we're tracking restocks on our live blog.</p>


<p>Best Buy is letting shoppers register interest to receive information about new restocks.</p>`,

        content: `<p>With this earlier-than-usual number update to Android, Google is focusing mostly on under-the-hood improvements and practical improvements.</p>

<p>Private Space and partial screen recording were added to Android 15, despite the fact that the update's visual improvements received little attention. This year, too, Google doesn’t seem too keen to focus much on a radical aesthetic overhaul.
   If you are curious about the update, here is everything you must know about Android 16, including when it will be available, which devices already have it, and which features are likely to make it to the final release.</p>

<h2>Android 16 developer</h2>

<p>Google released the Android 16 developer previews and beta months ahead of the usual schedule.  As such, Android 16 beta 3 is already live, and we have already reached the “Platform Stability” stage, suggesting Google is only making final touch-up and fixing bugs rather than testing new features.</p>
<p>This time period is for app developers to make changes. Based on the time release timeline, we expect the stable version of Android 16 to arrive sometime after April.</p>
<p>There is no better time than Google's annual developer conference, Google I/O, which will begin on May 20 this year, even though we do not have any official statements.</p>
<p>Android 16 is currently only available on Pixel phones made by Google, starting with the Pixel 6 and up. Although the list may expand over the coming weeks, these phones currently support Android 16 beta if you would to try:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pixel 6/6 Pro</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pixel 6a</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pixel 7/7 Pro</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pixel 7a</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pixel Fold</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pixel Tablet</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pixel 8/8 Pro</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pixel 8a</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pixel 8a</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pixel 9</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pixel 9</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pixel 9 Pro XL</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pixel 9 Pro Fold</strong></li>
</ul>

        title: 'Revolutionary AI Breakthrough: New Neural Network Architecture Achieves Human-Level Reasoning',
        excerpt: 'Scientists have developed a groundbreaking neural network that demonstrates unprecedented reasoning capabilities, marking a significant milestone in artificial intelligence research.',
        content: `<p>In a landmark achievement for artificial intelligence research, scientists at leading tech companies have unveiled a revolutionary neural network architecture that demonstrates human-level reasoning capabilities across multiple domains.</p>

<p>The new system, dubbed "ReasonNet," represents a significant departure from traditional transformer-based models. Instead of relying solely on pattern recognition, ReasonNet incorporates advanced logical reasoning mechanisms that allow it to understand cause-and-effect relationships, make inferences, and solve complex problems through step-by-step analysis.</p>

<h2>Key Innovations</h2>

<p>The breakthrough centers around three major innovations:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Dynamic Memory Architecture:</strong> Unlike static models, ReasonNet can dynamically allocate and reorganize its memory structures based on the complexity of the problem at hand.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Modal Reasoning:</strong> The system seamlessly integrates text, images, and numerical data to form comprehensive understanding and make informed decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Explainable AI Components:</strong> Every decision made by ReasonNet can be traced back through its reasoning process, providing unprecedented transparency in AI decision-making.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Real-World Applications</h2>

<p>Early testing has shown remarkable results across various fields:</p>

<p>In medical diagnosis, ReasonNet has demonstrated the ability to analyze complex cases involving multiple symptoms and medical history, providing diagnostic suggestions that match specialist-level accuracy. The system doesn't just identify patterns but explains its reasoning process, helping doctors understand the logic behind each recommendation.</p>

<p>Financial institutions are already exploring applications in risk assessment and fraud detection. The AI's ability to understand causal relationships makes it particularly effective at identifying sophisticated fraud schemes that might escape traditional detection methods.</p>

<h2>Implications for the Future</h2>

<p>This breakthrough represents more than just an incremental improvement in AI capabilities. It signals a fundamental shift toward artificial intelligence that can truly understand and reason about the world, rather than simply recognizing patterns in data.</p>

<p>As we move forward, the implications are profound. We may be witnessing the birth of AI systems that can engage in genuine problem-solving, collaborate meaningfully with humans, and tackle complex challenges that require deep understanding and reasoning.</p>`,

        title: 'The Nuclear Company is taking an old approach to building new nuclear reactors',
        excerpt: 'Rather than gin up a new design or try to mass manufacture smaller reactors, it wants to develop a series of reactors using existing designs',
        content: `<p>The two-year-old startup announced a Series A last month that included investments from CIV, Goldcrest Capital, MCJ Collective, True Ventures, and Wonder Ventures, though it did not disclose the amount raised.</p>

<p>Now, the company has secured $46.3 million in a Series A fundraise out of a targeted $51.3 million total,The details were published in an SEC filing.</p>
<p>The Nuclear Company was founded in 2023 by three serial entrepreneurs: former AppHarvest CEO Jonathan Webb, Arcadia CEO Kiran Bhatraju, and CIV CEO Patrick Maloney.  The startup is prioritizing sites that already have permits or licenses to operate.  According to Nuclear Regulatory Commission filings for combined operating licenses and early site permits, less than a dozen sites fall under that category.</p>
<p>At the sites that are closer to groundbreaking, each can support reactors with more than 1 gigawatt of generation capacity.  The Nuclear Company is aiming to develop 6 gigawatts in its first fleet.</p>
<p> The funding round arrives as tech companies and utilities are struggling to secure power for data centers.  Demand for electricity in the U.S. is expected to surge nearly 16% by 2029, according to Grid Strategies, after years of steady consumption.  Data centers are a large driver; their electricity use could quadruple by the end of the decade.</p>

<p>In the face of potential power shortages, tech companies have been cozying up to nuclear startups and developers.  Google is working with Kairos to build 500 megawatts worth of small modular reactors (SMR), while Amazon participated in a massive $700 million round to fund X-energy’s SMR plans</p>
<p>Meta has solicited proposals from developers to build up to 4 gigawatts of generating capacity, and Microsoft is working with Constellation Energy to restart a reactor at Three Mile Island.</p>

<p>But nuclear power is facing headwinds, both expected and unexpected.  Competition from solar power is among the former: tech companies and data center operators have been snapping up capacity from solar farms, signing sizable deals.</p>

<p>These farms are frequently paired with massive batteries to provide 24/7 electricity.  The technology is inexpensive, and new projects can be developed in around 18 months.</p>

<p>Nuclear may soon face other financial hurdles, too.  This week, the House Ways and Means Committee published its draft of a reconciliation bill that would kill subsidies for nuclear power that were granted under the Inflation Reduction Act.</p>

<p> Nuclear power plants are currently eligible for tax credits up to $15 per megawatt-hour</p>
<p>Most new nuclear power plants, including those on The Nuclear Company’s timeline, aren’t expected to come online until the early 2030s.</p>
<p>Given that forecasts for the next five years vary wildly, massive nuclear plants entering service a decade from now could be stuck holding the bag.</p>

<p> The world is awash in data about, well, the world — thanks to satellites and environmental sensors.  But there’s still a lot we can’t see, and Fieldstone Bio thinks microbes can change that.
    “They’ve evolved to sense and respond to information.  It’s just trillions of calculations going on at all times all around us,” Brandon Fields, Fieldstone Bio’s co-founder and chief science officer, told TechCrunch.  “How do we take that and actually manipulate that to gain benefits for us?”</p>

<p>Fieldstone’s technology emerged from that question.  The startup was founded in 2023 after spinning out of MIT, where professor Chris Voigt’s lab had developed a way to turn microbes into sensors.<p>

<p>The scientists programmed the microbes to change color when they encountered something of interest, whether it be nutrients in soil or landmines hidden in the dirt, and then figured out how to detect them.
                   “The key technology out of Chris’ lab is this idea of, ‘How do we actually visualize these cells from really far away?’”  Fields said.</p>
<p> Fieldstone Bio recently raised $5 million in seed funding led by Ubiquity Ventures with participation from E14 and LDV Capital, the company exclusively told TechCrunch.  The startup has been testing its technology in the lab, and the funding will let it test those microbes in the real world.</p>
<p>Each strain is tailored to sense a particular compound, such as nitrogen on a farm field or TNT residue from a landmine. <br>
                   “We isolate microbes from the environments we want to sense,” Fields said. </p>

<p>“We build our sensors the DNA pieces, and we just drop them into these different ones and see which ones behave the best, which ones can last the longest.”</p>`,

        title: 'Trump floats possible new F-55 warplane and F-22 upgrade',
        excerpt: 'The United States is examining development of a twin-engined warplane to be known as the F-55, as well as an upgrade to its Lockheed Martin (LMT.N), opens new tab F-22 Raptor called the F-22 Super, U.S.',
        content: `<p>Trump was speaking at a meeting of business leaders including the heads of Boeing (BA.N), opens new tab and GE Aerospace (GE.N), opens new tab in Doha, a day after announcing a string of business deals including an order from Qatar for 160 Boeing commercial jets.</p>

<p>Despite macroeconomic challenges, the technology sector continues to attract investment as companies demonstrate strong fundamentals and innovative capabilities that position them well for future growth.</p>

<h2>New F-55 warplane and F-22 upgrade</h2>

<p>After losing out to Boeing to replace the F-22 superfighter, Trump appeared to echo Lockheed's talk of a "best value" alternative and referred to the F-55 as both an upgrade to the F-35 and a new development. He also highlighted the role of the new air dominance platform called the F-47, recently awarded to Boeing (BA.N), opens new tab, and said the United States was simultaneously looking at upgrading the stealth fighter that it is designed to replace, the F-22.</p>
<p>"We're going to do an F-55 and - I think, if we get the right price, we have to get the right price - that'll be two engines and a super upgrade on the F-35, and then we're going to do the F-22," Trump said.
                       "I think the most beautiful fighter jet in the world is the F-22 but we're going to do an F-22 Super and it'll be a very modern version of the F-22 fighter jet," he said.</p>

<p>He added, "We're going to be going with it pretty quickly." Trump last month awarded Boeing the contract for the F-47 - a replacement for the Lockheed F-22 stealth fighter featuring a crewed aircraft flanked by a cohort of drones and seen as America's most advanced or sixth-generation fighter.</p>
<p>Lockheed Martin, which lost out to Boeing in that Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) competition and was dropped from a separate contest for a new U.S.  Navy stealth jet, has said it is now looking at plans for a "fifth-generation-plus" fighter.</p>
<p>CEO James Taiclet told analysts last month that Lockheed was looking at ways of applying technology developed for its losing bid for the F-47 contract to the F-35, delivering 80% of the capability for half the cost.</p>

<p>He stated to analysts, "We're basically going to take the chassis and turn it into a Ferrari." A Lockheed spokeswoman said "We thank President Trump for his support of the F-35 and F-22 and will continue to work closely with the Administration to realize its vision for air dominance."</p>

<h2>NEW AIRCRAFT</h2>

<p>Lockheed is separately in the midst of a delayed technology and software upgrade for the existing generation of F-35 strike fighter to boost cockpit displays and processing power.</p>

<p>Analysts said it was not immediately clear how Trump's list of potential developments fitted into known programmes and spending plans, or the timing of existing programmes.</p>
<p>According to Nick Cunningham, an aerospace analyst with Agency Partners, the term "F-55" could also refer to the F/A-XX program, which was designed to take over for the United States. Navy's ageing Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet fleet with the service's own sixth-generation stealth fighter.</p>

<p>Reuters reported on Wednesday that the Navy and Congress are battling the administration to keep the plans moving forward. Announcement of a winning bidder had been expected as early as March.</p>

<p>Funding of the radar-evading F-22, which is designed to combat other fighters, has been fiercely debated for years as Congress blocked plans by the Air Force to speed up retirements to focus on the next generation blueprint that became the F-47.</p>

<p>Any significant upgrade to the out-of-production F-22 would be costly, while Trump's reference to two engines implies the F-55 would not be a straightforward derivative of the single-engined F-35 but imply an ambitious new platform, analysts said.</p>

<p>"Adding an engine to the F-35 makes it a new aircraft," UK-based defence analyst Francis Tusa said.</p>`,

        excerpt: 'Windsurf, a startup that develops popular AI tools for software engineers, announced the launch of its first family of AI software engineering models, or SWE-1 for short.',
        content: `<p>The startup says it trained its new family of AI models — SWE-1, SWE-1-lite, and SWE-1-mini — to be optimized for the “entire software engineering process,” not just coding.</p?
<p>The launch of Windsurf’s in-house AI models may come as a shock to some, given that OpenAI has reportedly closed a $3 billion deal to acquire Windsurf.  However, the launch of this model suggests that Windsurf is attempting to develop not only applications but also the models that power them.</p>
<h2>WindSurf</h2>

<p>According to Windsurf, SWE-1, the largest and most capable AI model of the bunch, performs competitively with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, and Gemini 2.5 Pro on internal programming benchmarks.  However, SWE-1 appears to fall short of frontier AI models, such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet, on software engineering tasks.</p>

<p>Windsurf says its SWE-1-lite and SWE-1-mini models will be available for all users on its platform, free or paid.  Meanwhile, SWE-1 will only be available to paid users.  Windsurf did not immediately announce pricing for its SWE-1 models but claims it’s cheaper to serve than Claude 3.5 Sonnet.</p>

<p>Windsurf is best known for tools that allow software engineers to write and edit code through conversations with an AI chatbot, a practice known as “vibe coding.”  Other popular vibe-coding startups include Cursor, the largest in the space, as well as Lovable. </p>

<p>The majority of these startups, including Windsurf, have traditionally powered their applications with AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. In a video announcing the SWE models, comments made by Windsurf’s Head of Research, Nicholas Moy, underscore Windsurf’s newest efforts to differentiate its approach.  “Today’s frontier models are optimized for coding, and they’ve made massive strides over the last couple of years,” says Moy.  “But they’re not enough for us … Coding is not software engineering.”</p>
<p>Windsurf notes in a blog post that while other models are good at writing code, they struggle to work between multiple surfaces — as programmers often do — such as terminals, IDEs, and the internet.</p>

<p>The startup says SWE-1 was trained using a new data model and a “training recipe that encapsulates incomplete states, long-running tasks, and multiple surfaces.”</p>`,

<p>In U.S. federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, on Friday evening, a notice outlining the preliminary settlement was filed. The accord requires a judge's approval.</p>


<p>Depositors said Capital One falsely promised high interest rates on its 360 Savings accounts while quietly offering much better rates to new customers on the similarly named 360 Performance Savings accounts.</p>

<p>The 360 Savings depositors said Capital One froze their rates at 0.3% while offering rates to 360 Performance Savings depositors that peaked at 4.35% early last year.
                   The higher-yielding account now yields 3.6%.</p>

<p>Under the settlement, Capital One will pay 360 Savings depositors $300 million to cover interest they could have received on 360 Performance Savings accounts.</p>

<p>It also will pay $125 million of additional interest to depositors who still have 360 Savings accounts.</p>

<p>The settlement covers depositors with 360 Savings accounts at any time since September 18, 2019.  Legal fees will be paid from the settlement.</p>

<p>Capital One, based in McLean, Virginia, did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing to settle.  It did not immediately respond to requests for comment outside business hours.</p>

<p>The U.S.  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau filed a similar lawsuit in January before President Donald Trump took office,

        excerpt: 'Carrier Announces Additional $1 Billion Investment in U.S Manufacturing Footprint, Advanced Cutting-Edge R&D and Workforce Expansion',
        content: `<p>In addition to its ongoing commitments to American operations, Carrier Global Corporation (NYSE: CARR), a global leader in intelligent climate and energy solutions, today announced plans to invest an additional $1 billion over five years in U.S. manufacturing, innovation, and workforce expansion.</p>

<p>Carrier Chairman and CEO David Gitlin stated, "This investment marks the next chapter in our commitment to U.S. manufacturing."</p>
<p>"We are building for the future by creating high-quality, skilled trade careers and empowering American workers to lead the next generation of manufacturing.</p>

<p> At the same time, it positions Carrier to capture the tremendous growth ahead in our industry and deliver smart, differentiated solutions for our customers."</p>

<p>The additional investment will fund the expansion of existing facilities and construction of a new state-of-the-art manufacturing site to support the production of highly engineered components for heat pumps and battery assemblies - both essential to Carrier's Home Energy Management System (HEMS).</p>
<p>It will also accelerate next-generation R&D, including innovations in liquid cooling for data centers and battery-enabled climate solutions technologies developed under Carrier Energy, the company's bold, in-house start up focused on optimizing home energy use and supporting grid flexibility.</p>
<p>Carrier's TechVantage initiative, announced in January, is included in both the $1 billion investment and anticipated 4,000 jobs.</p>
<p>The program aims to hire 1,000 U.S. service technicians and train more than 100,000 climate solutions service and sales professionals over the next five years.</p>
<p>This effort is focused on developing the skilled workforce needed to support the installation and servicing of high-performance climate solutions systems.</p>

<p>Based in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, Carrier is the largest U.S.-headquartered company in its industry and continues to invest in its American operations to strengthen manufacturing capabilities and drive long-term growth.</p>

<p>Over the past five years, the company has grown its U.S. workforce by approximately 20 percent, reinforcing its long-standing commitment to American manufacturing, innovation and economic growth.</p>`,

        title: 'ZeroAvia, a clean-aircraft startup',
        excerpt: 'ZeroAvia is working on a new funding round to raise approximately $150 million as it moves closer to commercializing its first hydrogen fuel-cell engine',
        content: `<p>The company is in discussions with strategic and financial investors for the Series D funding, Chief Executive Officer Val Miftakhov said in an interview.</p>
<p>He aims to identify a lead investor on the round, which has been under way for about six weeks, by the Paris Air Show in mid-June</p>
<p>“This round will take us all the way to the end of ’28,” Miftakhov said.  The company is likely to need further incremental funding, but once it starts shipping products “we can also go IPO.”</p>

<h2>ZeroAvia</h2>
<p>This week, ZeroAvia announced a launch customer for its initial engine, the ZA600.  UK cargo-services firm RVL Aviation plans to operate a Cessna Grand Caravan retrofitted with the hydrogen-electric powertrain on flights within the British Isles. </p>
<p>The US Federal Aviation Administration, which is in charge of the electric motor, and the UK Civil Aviation Authority, which is evaluating the hydrogen fuel cell system, are coordinating certification.</p>

<p>The company is on track to start commercial operations by late next year or early 2027, Miftakhov said.</p>
<p>There are about 1,000 Cessna Caravans in service in the configuration that will receive the first approvals, an addressable market that could expand to about 3,000, he said. </p>
<p>He added that the current funding round should be sufficient for the ZA600 program to reach positive cash flow. </p>
<p>Before moving on to providing engines for brand-new aircraft, the company has been collaborating with operators, aircraft manufacturers, and others in the sector to enter the engine-replacement market first.</p>

<p>Miftakhov, who has reached tentative deals to supply American Airlines Group Inc., United Airlines Holdings Inc. and Alaska Air Group Inc. with engines for their regional turboprops,
    sees ZeroAvia becoming a disruptor in an aircraft-engine industry dominated by a handful of players,
    including Pratt & Whitney, Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc, General Electric Co. and Safran SA. </p>


<p>Its approach has been to start small — a Cessna aircraft that can be configured to seat up to 14 passengers — before moving into higher-capacity aircraft.  Its next engine, the ZA2000, is aimed at turboprops seating up to 80 passengers.</p>

<h2>Prior Rounds</h2>
<p>ZeroAvia, which is based in the US but has about 200 of its 300 employees in the UK, has raised about $300 million, including prior equity rounds and grants.</p>
<p>The hydrogen-aviation sector has seen numerous setbacks in recent months — competitor Universal Hydrogen folded last year, and planemaker Airbus SE has pushed back its timeline for making a hydrogen-powered commercial airliner,
                      dealing a major blow to efforts to build infrastructure like airport facilities and green-hydrogen fuel production.  </p>


<p>In the meantime, the political outlook has become less friendly to clean tech in the US under President Donald Trump, and Europe is shifting money from green projects toward the defense sector. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, Miftakhov said ZeroAvia has benefited from having a less-cluttered field. </p>
<p>The company was selected earlier this year a US Air Force grant to study integrating hydrogen propulsion into Cessna aircraft alongside autonomous technology.</p>
<p>“I don’t think there is a significant doubt that we are going to electrify aviation,” Miftakhov said.</p>
<p>“It starts with small aircraft, but it goes larger and larger.”</p>`,

        title: 'The Future of Digital Finance is Customer-Centric',
        excerpt: 'As we move deeper into the digital age, one trend in the financial services industry stands out above the rest: the shift toward customer-centricity.',
        content: `<p>Gone are the days when banks and financial institutions operated as gatekeepers with limited access points and generic services. </p>
<p>Today, empowered by technology and driven by consumer expectations, the future of digital finance is being shaped around the individual — their needs, their behaviors, and their experiences</p>
<h2>From Institution-Focused to Customer-First</h2>
<p>Traditional finance was built on rigid systems designed primarily for operational efficiency and regulatory compliance. </p>
<p>Customers had to conform to the structure — limited service hours, complex paperwork, and impersonal interactions.</p>

<p>However, the rise of digital platforms has flipped the script. With fintech innovation, mobile banking, AI, and blockchain, users now expect seamless, personalized, and on-demand financial experiences.</p>
<p>Financial providers are being pushed to transform. It’s not enough to offer digital access; institutions must understand customers holistically, anticipate their needs, and deliver tailored solutions in real time. </p>
<p>In this new paradigm, success hinges on delivering value-driven experiences rather than merely transactional services.</p>

<h2>Data as New Currency</h2>
<p>One of the key enablers of customer-centric finance is data.</p>
<p>From transaction histories and behavioral patterns to lifestyle choices and social signals, today’s financial systems can gather unprecedented amounts of customer data.</p>
<p>The intelligent use of this data — with privacy and ethics at the forefront — allows companies to deliver hyper-personalized experiences.</p>
<p>Machine learning and AI tools now predict spending habits, recommend savings plans, detect fraud proactively, and even offer tailored investment advice.</p>
<p>These smart, data-driven insights transform the user from a passive recipient to an active participant in their financial journey.</p>

<h2>OmniChannel Engagemnt & UX</h2>
<p>In a truly customer-centric digital finance ecosystem, the experience must be seamless across platforms — mobile apps, websites, ATMs, or customer service centers. </p>
<p>Users expect continuity, speed, and convenience.</p>
<p>Fintech startups have raised the bar with intuitive interfaces and delightful user experiences. As a result, traditional banks are investing heavily in UX design, mobile-first development, and API integration with third-party platforms.</p>
<p>The goal? To meet customers wherever they are — physically and digitally.</p>

<h2>Financial Inclusion and Accessibility</h2>
<p>A customer-centric future must also address accessibility. Digital finance opens the door to underserved populations, especially in developing regions. </p>
<p>Mobile wallets, digital lending platforms, and biometric authentication are bringing financial services to individuals who were historically excluded.</p>
<p>By designing products with inclusivity in mind — simple interfaces, vernacular language options, 
                  low-bandwidth solutions — digital finance can empower entire communities and bridge socioeconomic gaps.</p>

<h2>Trust & Transparency</h2>
<p>Customer-centricity also means prioritizing trust. With growing concerns about data security, identity theft, and algorithmic bias, institutions must be transparent in how they operate. </p>
<p>Customers want to know: </p>
<ul>
<li>- How their data is used.</li>
<li>- What protections are in place.</li>
<li>- Whether AI decisions are fair and explainable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Building digital trust will be a competitive advantage in the years ahead. </p>
<p>It requires clear communication, strong cybersecurity, and ethical governance frameworks.</p>

<h2>The Role of Human Touch in a Digital World </h2>
<p>While automation and AI drive efficiency, the human element remains vital.</p>
<p>Financial decisions — from mortgages to retirement planning — are deeply personal. The future of digital finance lies in augmenting human interaction with technology, not replacing it.</p>
<p>Digital platforms that allow users to quickly access human advisors, receive empathetic support, or get customized advice will stand out. </p>
<p>The ideal blend is a hybrid model: intelligent automation with easy access to human expertise when needed.</p>

<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>The transformation toward a customer-centric financial future is not optional — it’s imperative. Financial institutions that embrace this shift will unlock new levels of loyalty, engagement, and long-term growth.</p>
<p>Those that resist will be left behind.</p>
<p>In this future, success won't be defined by the number of branches or even the size of an institution's balance sheet.</p>
<p>Instead, it will be measured by how well an organization understands, serves, and evolves with its customers.</p>

<p>Digital finance is no longer about digitizing old systems — it’s about reimagining finance around people.</p>`,
