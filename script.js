        title: '2025 Could easily be Nintendos Year',
        excerpt: ' If you squinted, you could see a shadow that looked a little bit like Florida over 2025.',
        content: `<p>Naturally, that was the specter of GTA 6, which was originally scheduled to launch later this year but was moved to next year, on May 26, 2026.</p>
<p>The year could have been completely dominated by Rockstar's next epic, but the skies have cleared to let another giant release take 2025 as its own - the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<h2>Nintendo Switch 2</h2>

<p>Nintendo needs to make this first year of Switch 2 really matter if it wants to win in 2025. Even when you take into account major releases like Death Stranding 2, Elden Ring Nightreign, Borderlands 4, and, dare I say it, Hollow Knight: Silksong, Nintendo's new console is now the biggest launch of 2025 by quite a bit. However, with just one major launch game, the remainder of 2025 will need to be counted.</p>

<h2>Pole position</h2>


<p>Switch 2 is starting strong, launching hand-in-hand with potentially the best ever Mario Kart game yet in Mario Kart World on June 5. </p>

<p>Its introduction of open-world exploration, evolution of Grand Prix races, and brand new, brilliantly chaotic Knockout Tours means that it's going to be the game everyone is talking about and sharing across their social media in June. </p>

<p>If it's got the staying power that Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has had (it's still one of the best-selling games of all time and the best-selling Switch game), the Switch 2 is out the starting gate with a bang.
                       But then, before you know it, we're into July where Nintendo has already scheduled our second big release for Switch 2 in Donkey Kong: Bananza.  Despite the brain ache it gives me every time trying to get the Bananza spelling right, this is exciting territory for DK.</p>



<p>It's the first 3D Donkey Kong game for 26 years (the last being Donkey Kong 64 on the N64) and from what I've played at the Switch 2 preview event, it feels like DK being given the Super Mario Odyssey treatment, to the point that if you switched out the ape for our old plumber pal you could argue it's essentially Super Mario Odyssey 2 in all but name.</p>

<p>While DK's next outing isn't launching day one but on July 17, it is arriving in what we call the launch window for Switch 2, and provides an excellent excitement build just over a month after the console's debut.</p>

<p>That's two big exclusives within as many months for Switch 2.  And that's without even noting the big event that's happening between those two dates.</p>

<p>Summer Game Fest, the big June gaming industry event that's now emerged victorious from the remains of E3, is running from June 6 - 10, and usually Nintendo takes its usual slot on the Tuesday (this year being June 10) to drop a livestreamed Nintendo Direct.</p>

<p>It hasn't announced one yet for this year, but it's also not unlike Nintendo to drop such an event with 24-48 hours' notice.</p>


<h2>Closing The Year</h2>

<p>We have two major, undated Switch 2 exclusives that are due to launch in 2025 that may get release dates during an SGF presentation.  Knowing when Metroid Prime 4: Beyond and Pokemon Legends: Z-A will arrive for Nintendo Switch 2 will outline the agenda for the Switch 2's first year as - hopefully - continued critically-acclaimed exclusives.</p>

<p>There are also titles like Kirby Air Riders, Drag x Drive, and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment still to come in 2025 that are also currently dateless and exclusive to Switch 2.  Again, they're really bolstering this first year line-up for the Switch 2 and only aiding the idea that this year could well be dominated by Nintendo releases.</p>

<p>With GTA 6 now set to take over 2026, and with console exclusives for Xbox and PlayStation currently being a little scarce beyond the likes of The Outer Worlds 2 and Ghost of Yotei (at least so far), 2025 really is Nintendo's.</p>

<p>From the outline we have already for releases, it already feels like Switch 2 is the console to have in 2025.</p>

<p>If Nintendo can keep up with what it's already promised, it's going to be quite the first year for Switch 2.</p>`,

        title: 'Nintendo is  Switch 2 Here',
        excerpt: 'The Nintendo Switch 2 is real and its launching in June',
        content: `<p> After literally years of unverified rumors, dubious leaks and copious amounts of online speculation, Nintendo revealed its next-generation console, and it’s the Switch sequel the majority expected (and many of us wanted).</p>


<p>First announced back in January and then fully unveiled at the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct event in April along with 22 launch games, the Switch 2 is an evolution of the existing Nintendo Switch console rather than a reinvention of the wheel.</p>

<p>On the surface, the Nintendo Switch 2 looks largely identical to its predecessor, but there is one key difference: Switch 2 is bigger!
                 In the handheld world, bigger is increasingly meaning better, with chunky units like Steam Deck OLED ruling supreme, and Nintendo is following the trend.  Prepare your pockets because the Nintendo Switch 2 isn’t a slim device.</p>

<p>In the original Switch 2 reveal trailer, Nintendo cleverly showcased the Switch 2’s increased size by comparing it with the current Switch.  It will sport a larger display size and thinner bezels.</p>

<p>Another noticeable design tweak is the new kickstand.  It will cover the entire back of the console and is adjustable so you can view the display from multiple angles.  It’s a huge leap from the regular Switch’s restrictive (and flimsy) kickstand but comparable with the kickstand added to the Nintendo Switch OLED model in 2021.</p>


<p>One of the big Nintendo Switch 2 rumors was the addition of a mysterious “C button.”  Yesterday, a brief video was uploaded to the Nintendo Today app. But now, during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, Nintendo has officially unveiled this button, which works with the new GameChat feature.</p>

<p>The system's new chat system can be accessed by pressing the C button on the right joystick. The menu in question appears very similar to the one you’d see on Discord, with each player’s camera showing up as tiles on the screen.</p>


<p>Speaking of the Joy-Cons, Nintendo also showed off mouse-like controls for its controllers.  The control scheme mirrors how a PC mouse works, where you put both Joy-cons on a table or surface and roll them to control whatever is on the screen.</p>


<p> There are also elements of motion controls similar to what we've already seen on the original Nintendo Switch, where you can jerk your wrist with the controller in-hand to toss a ball, or something similar.</p>
<p>At a glance, there might not appear to be much new, but Switch 2’s Joy-Cons won’t just be bigger, but they will also connect to the console in a new way.  The railing system is out, and instead, a new connection method has been implemented.</p>


<p>The Switch 2’s reveal video showcases this change and the way the Joy-Cons snap onto the Switch 2’s main console unit sure does look satisfying.</p>

<p>In docked mode, the Switch 2 can hit up to 4K (3840 x 2160) resolution at 60 frames per second.  It also supports 120 fps when 1920x1080 or 2560x1440 resolutions are selected.  The system supports HDR10 and a 1920x1080 resolution in tabletop mode and handheld mode, following screen resolution.</p>

<p>The Switch 2 also ships with a redesigned dock.  The new dock features softer, rounded edges, and more of the display is visible when docked — whether this will be used for gameplay features remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Nintendo says the Switch 2 will have up to 6.5 hours of battery life, depending on what games you're playing.  The system will sport a pair of USB-C ports.</p>

<p>The original Nintendo Switch didn’t have the same voice chat functionality as the PS5 and Xbox Series X.  Because of that, the new GameChat feature is one of the most important features coming to Nintendo’s console.  Here’s how it works.
                           The GameChat overlay looks like the Discord chat overlay.  A small microphone on top of the console picks up your voice, even from a distance.</p>


<p>Nintendo says there’s noise canceling, so you won’t have to worry if you’re playing in a noisy environment.  And as seen in the video, it appears you can press the C button to mute yourself.  This works whether you’re in handheld or docked mode.</p>

<p>There are other functions similar to PS5.  You’ll be able to chat across different games, view another player’s screen, and share your screen.  You can even use the brand-new Nintendo Switch 2 camera while gaming. As expected, the Nintendo Switch 2 will support a slew of accessories.</p>


<p>Most notably, we were introduced to GameChat, Nintendo's new in-game chat system.  This incorporates the all-new peripheral, the Switch 2 Camera, which can add your friendly face to multiplayer sessions or even incorporate your image into select titles like Super Mario Party Jamboree.</p>



<p>Price info for all the new Nintendo Switch 2 accessories, including controllers, carry cases, and peripherals, has now been confirmed on the official Nintendo website.</p>

<p>You can find a full list below:</p>
<ul>
<li>strong>Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller: $79.99 ($10 more than the original Pro Controller RRP)</strong></li>
<li>strong>Joy-Con 2 controllers: $89.99 ($10 more than original Joy-Con pairs)</strong></li>
<li>strong>Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip: $34.99</strong></li>
<li>strong>Joy-Con 2 Strap: $12.99</strong></li>
<li>strong>Joy-Con 2 Wheel (set of two): $19.99</strong></li>
<li>strong>Nintendo Switch 2 Camera: $49.99</strong></li>

<li>strong>Nintendo Switch 2 All-in-One Carry Case: $79</strong></li>
<li>strong>Nintendo Switch 2 AC Adapter: $29 (same as original Switch)</strong></li>
<ul>

<p>Overall, the new peripherals aren't much more expensive than they already were.</p>

<p>While the system might appear similar to its predecessor, its strength lies in its refinement and an impressive assortment of first and third-party games.</p>

<p>Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders will begin on Wednesday, April 9 in the US.  The standalone Nintendo Switch 2 console will cost $449 / AU$699 / £395. </p>

<p>Alternatively, there will be a Switch 2 bundle that includes a digital copy of Mario Kart World for $499 / AU$769 / £429.  The Nintendo Switch 2 will be widely available starting June 5th.</p>

<p>In the U.S., retailers such as Amazon and Best Buy are already sold out of pre-orders but we're tracking restocks on our live blog.</p>


<p>Best Buy is letting shoppers register interest to receive information about new restocks.</p>`,

        content: `<p>With this earlier-than-usual number update to Android, Google is focusing mostly on under-the-hood improvements and practical improvements.</p>

<p>Private Space and partial screen recording were added to Android 15, despite the fact that the update's visual improvements received little attention. This year, too, Google doesn’t seem too keen to focus much on a radical aesthetic overhaul.
   If you are curious about the update, here is everything you must know about Android 16, including when it will be available, which devices already have it, and which features are likely to make it to the final release.</p>

<h2>Android 16 developer</h2>

<p>Google released the Android 16 developer previews and beta months ahead of the usual schedule.  As such, Android 16 beta 3 is already live, and we have already reached the “Platform Stability” stage, suggesting Google is only making final touch-up and fixing bugs rather than testing new features.</p>
<p>This time period is for app developers to make changes. Based on the time release timeline, we expect the stable version of Android 16 to arrive sometime after April.</p>
<p>There is no better time than Google's annual developer conference, Google I/O, which will begin on May 20 this year, even though we do not have any official statements.</p>
<p>Android 16 is currently only available on Pixel phones made by Google, starting with the Pixel 6 and up. Although the list may expand over the coming weeks, these phones currently support Android 16 beta if you would to try:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pixel 6/6 Pro</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pixel 6a</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pixel 7/7 Pro</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pixel 7a</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pixel Fold</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pixel Tablet</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pixel 8/8 Pro</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pixel 8a</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pixel 8a</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pixel 9</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pixel 9</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pixel 9 Pro XL</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pixel 9 Pro Fold</strong></li>
</ul>

        title: 'Revolutionary AI Breakthrough: New Neural Network Architecture Achieves Human-Level Reasoning',
        excerpt: 'Scientists have developed a groundbreaking neural network that demonstrates unprecedented reasoning capabilities, marking a significant milestone in artificial intelligence research.',
        content: `<p>In a landmark achievement for artificial intelligence research, scientists at leading tech companies have unveiled a revolutionary neural network architecture that demonstrates human-level reasoning capabilities across multiple domains.</p>

<p>The new system, dubbed "ReasonNet," represents a significant departure from traditional transformer-based models. Instead of relying solely on pattern recognition, ReasonNet incorporates advanced logical reasoning mechanisms that allow it to understand cause-and-effect relationships, make inferences, and solve complex problems through step-by-step analysis.</p>

<h2>Key Innovations</h2>

<p>The breakthrough centers around three major innovations:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Dynamic Memory Architecture:</strong> Unlike static models, ReasonNet can dynamically allocate and reorganize its memory structures based on the complexity of the problem at hand.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Modal Reasoning:</strong> The system seamlessly integrates text, images, and numerical data to form comprehensive understanding and make informed decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Explainable AI Components:</strong> Every decision made by ReasonNet can be traced back through its reasoning process, providing unprecedented transparency in AI decision-making.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Real-World Applications</h2>

<p>Early testing has shown remarkable results across various fields:</p>

<p>In medical diagnosis, ReasonNet has demonstrated the ability to analyze complex cases involving multiple symptoms and medical history, providing diagnostic suggestions that match specialist-level accuracy. The system doesn't just identify patterns but explains its reasoning process, helping doctors understand the logic behind each recommendation.</p>

<p>Financial institutions are already exploring applications in risk assessment and fraud detection. The AI's ability to understand causal relationships makes it particularly effective at identifying sophisticated fraud schemes that might escape traditional detection methods.</p>

<h2>Implications for the Future</h2>

<p>This breakthrough represents more than just an incremental improvement in AI capabilities. It signals a fundamental shift toward artificial intelligence that can truly understand and reason about the world, rather than simply recognizing patterns in data.</p>

<p>As we move forward, the implications are profound. We may be witnessing the birth of AI systems that can engage in genuine problem-solving, collaborate meaningfully with humans, and tackle complex challenges that require deep understanding and reasoning.</p>`,

        title: 'The Nuclear Company is taking an old approach to building new nuclear reactors',
        excerpt: 'Rather than gin up a new design or try to mass manufacture smaller reactors, it wants to develop a series of reactors using existing designs',
        content: `<p>The two-year-old startup announced a Series A last month that included investments from CIV, Goldcrest Capital, MCJ Collective, True Ventures, and Wonder Ventures, though it did not disclose the amount raised.</p>

<p>Now, the company has secured $46.3 million in a Series A fundraise out of a targeted $51.3 million total,The details were published in an SEC filing.</p>
<p>The Nuclear Company was founded in 2023 by three serial entrepreneurs: former AppHarvest CEO Jonathan Webb, Arcadia CEO Kiran Bhatraju, and CIV CEO Patrick Maloney.  The startup is prioritizing sites that already have permits or licenses to operate.  According to Nuclear Regulatory Commission filings for combined operating licenses and early site permits, less than a dozen sites fall under that category.</p>
<p>At the sites that are closer to groundbreaking, each can support reactors with more than 1 gigawatt of generation capacity.  The Nuclear Company is aiming to develop 6 gigawatts in its first fleet.</p>
<p> The funding round arrives as tech companies and utilities are struggling to secure power for data centers.  Demand for electricity in the U.S. is expected to surge nearly 16% by 2029, according to Grid Strategies, after years of steady consumption.  Data centers are a large driver; their electricity use could quadruple by the end of the decade.</p>

<p>In the face of potential power shortages, tech companies have been cozying up to nuclear startups and developers.  Google is working with Kairos to build 500 megawatts worth of small modular reactors (SMR), while Amazon participated in a massive $700 million round to fund X-energy’s SMR plans</p>
<p>Meta has solicited proposals from developers to build up to 4 gigawatts of generating capacity, and Microsoft is working with Constellation Energy to restart a reactor at Three Mile Island.</p>

<p>But nuclear power is facing headwinds, both expected and unexpected.  Competition from solar power is among the former: tech companies and data center operators have been snapping up capacity from solar farms, signing sizable deals.</p>

<p>These farms are frequently paired with massive batteries to provide 24/7 electricity.  The technology is inexpensive, and new projects can be developed in around 18 months.</p>

<p>Nuclear may soon face other financial hurdles, too.  This week, the House Ways and Means Committee published its draft of a reconciliation bill that would kill subsidies for nuclear power that were granted under the Inflation Reduction Act.</p>

<p> Nuclear power plants are currently eligible for tax credits up to $15 per megawatt-hour</p>
<p>Most new nuclear power plants, including those on The Nuclear Company’s timeline, aren’t expected to come online until the early 2030s.</p>
<p>Given that forecasts for the next five years vary wildly, massive nuclear plants entering service a decade from now could be stuck holding the bag.</p>

<p> The world is awash in data about, well, the world — thanks to satellites and environmental sensors.  But there’s still a lot we can’t see, and Fieldstone Bio thinks microbes can change that.
    “They’ve evolved to sense and respond to information.  It’s just trillions of calculations going on at all times all around us,” Brandon Fields, Fieldstone Bio’s co-founder and chief science officer, told TechCrunch.  “How do we take that and actually manipulate that to gain benefits for us?”</p>

<p>Fieldstone’s technology emerged from that question.  The startup was founded in 2023 after spinning out of MIT, where professor Chris Voigt’s lab had developed a way to turn microbes into sensors.<p>

<p>The scientists programmed the microbes to change color when they encountered something of interest, whether it be nutrients in soil or landmines hidden in the dirt, and then figured out how to detect them.
                   “The key technology out of Chris’ lab is this idea of, ‘How do we actually visualize these cells from really far away?’”  Fields said.</p>
<p> Fieldstone Bio recently raised $5 million in seed funding led by Ubiquity Ventures with participation from E14 and LDV Capital, the company exclusively told TechCrunch.  The startup has been testing its technology in the lab, and the funding will let it test those microbes in the real world.</p>
<p>Each strain is tailored to sense a particular compound, such as nitrogen on a farm field or TNT residue from a landmine. <br>
                   “We isolate microbes from the environments we want to sense,” Fields said. </p>

<p>“We build our sensors the DNA pieces, and we just drop them into these different ones and see which ones behave the best, which ones can last the longest.”</p>`,

        title: 'Trump floats possible new F-55 warplane and F-22 upgrade',
        excerpt: 'The United States is examining development of a twin-engined warplane to be known as the F-55, as well as an upgrade to its Lockheed Martin (LMT.N), opens new tab F-22 Raptor called the F-22 Super, U.S.',
        content: `<p>Trump was speaking at a meeting of business leaders including the heads of Boeing (BA.N), opens new tab and GE Aerospace (GE.N), opens new tab in Doha, a day after announcing a string of business deals including an order from Qatar for 160 Boeing commercial jets.</p>

<p>Despite macroeconomic challenges, the technology sector continues to attract investment as companies demonstrate strong fundamentals and innovative capabilities that position them well for future growth.</p>

<h2>New F-55 warplane and F-22 upgrade</h2>

<p>After losing out to Boeing to replace the F-22 superfighter, Trump appeared to echo Lockheed's talk of a "best value" alternative and referred to the F-55 as both an upgrade to the F-35 and a new development. He also highlighted the role of the new air dominance platform called the F-47, recently awarded to Boeing (BA.N), opens new tab, and said the United States was simultaneously looking at upgrading the stealth fighter that it is designed to replace, the F-22.</p>
<p>"We're going to do an F-55 and - I think, if we get the right price, we have to get the right price - that'll be two engines and a super upgrade on the F-35, and then we're going to do the F-22," Trump said.
                       "I think the most beautiful fighter jet in the world is the F-22 but we're going to do an F-22 Super and it'll be a very modern version of the F-22 fighter jet," he said.</p>

<p>He added, "We're going to be going with it pretty quickly." Trump last month awarded Boeing the contract for the F-47 - a replacement for the Lockheed F-22 stealth fighter featuring a crewed aircraft flanked by a cohort of drones and seen as America's most advanced or sixth-generation fighter.</p>
<p>Lockheed Martin, which lost out to Boeing in that Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) competition and was dropped from a separate contest for a new U.S.  Navy stealth jet, has said it is now looking at plans for a "fifth-generation-plus" fighter.</p>
<p>CEO James Taiclet told analysts last month that Lockheed was looking at ways of applying technology developed for its losing bid for the F-47 contract to the F-35, delivering 80% of the capability for half the cost.</p>

<p>He stated to analysts, "We're basically going to take the chassis and turn it into a Ferrari." A Lockheed spokeswoman said "We thank President Trump for his support of the F-35 and F-22 and will continue to work closely with the Administration to realize its vision for air dominance."</p>

<h2>NEW AIRCRAFT</h2>

<p>Lockheed is separately in the midst of a delayed technology and software upgrade for the existing generation of F-35 strike fighter to boost cockpit displays and processing power.</p>

<p>Analysts said it was not immediately clear how Trump's list of potential developments fitted into known programmes and spending plans, or the timing of existing programmes.</p>
<p>According to Nick Cunningham, an aerospace analyst with Agency Partners, the term "F-55" could also refer to the F/A-XX program, which was designed to take over for the United States. Navy's ageing Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet fleet with the service's own sixth-generation stealth fighter.</p>

<p>Reuters reported on Wednesday that the Navy and Congress are battling the administration to keep the plans moving forward. Announcement of a winning bidder had been expected as early as March.</p>

<p>Funding of the radar-evading F-22, which is designed to combat other fighters, has been fiercely debated for years as Congress blocked plans by the Air Force to speed up retirements to focus on the next generation blueprint that became the F-47.</p>

<p>Any significant upgrade to the out-of-production F-22 would be costly, while Trump's reference to two engines implies the F-55 would not be a straightforward derivative of the single-engined F-35 but imply an ambitious new platform, analysts said.</p>

<p>"Adding an engine to the F-35 makes it a new aircraft," UK-based defence analyst Francis Tusa said.</p>`,

        excerpt: 'Windsurf, a startup that develops popular AI tools for software engineers, announced the launch of its first family of AI software engineering models, or SWE-1 for short.',
        content: `<p>The startup says it trained its new family of AI models — SWE-1, SWE-1-lite, and SWE-1-mini — to be optimized for the “entire software engineering process,” not just coding.</p?
<p>The launch of Windsurf’s in-house AI models may come as a shock to some, given that OpenAI has reportedly closed a $3 billion deal to acquire Windsurf.  However, the launch of this model suggests that Windsurf is attempting to develop not only applications but also the models that power them.</p>
<h2>WindSurf</h2>

<p>According to Windsurf, SWE-1, the largest and most capable AI model of the bunch, performs competitively with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, and Gemini 2.5 Pro on internal programming benchmarks.  However, SWE-1 appears to fall short of frontier AI models, such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet, on software engineering tasks.</p>

<p>Windsurf says its SWE-1-lite and SWE-1-mini models will be available for all users on its platform, free or paid.  Meanwhile, SWE-1 will only be available to paid users.  Windsurf did not immediately announce pricing for its SWE-1 models but claims it’s cheaper to serve than Claude 3.5 Sonnet.</p>

<p>Windsurf is best known for tools that allow software engineers to write and edit code through conversations with an AI chatbot, a practice known as “vibe coding.”  Other popular vibe-coding startups include Cursor, the largest in the space, as well as Lovable. </p>

<p>The majority of these startups, including Windsurf, have traditionally powered their applications with AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. In a video announcing the SWE models, comments made by Windsurf’s Head of Research, Nicholas Moy, underscore Windsurf’s newest efforts to differentiate its approach.  “Today’s frontier models are optimized for coding, and they’ve made massive strides over the last couple of years,” says Moy.  “But they’re not enough for us … Coding is not software engineering.”</p>
<p>Windsurf notes in a blog post that while other models are good at writing code, they struggle to work between multiple surfaces — as programmers often do — such as terminals, IDEs, and the internet.</p>

<p>The startup says SWE-1 was trained using a new data model and a “training recipe that encapsulates incomplete states, long-running tasks, and multiple surfaces.”</p>`,

<p>In U.S. federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, on Friday evening, a notice outlining the preliminary settlement was filed. The accord requires a judge's approval.</p>


<p>Depositors said Capital One falsely promised high interest rates on its 360 Savings accounts while quietly offering much better rates to new customers on the similarly named 360 Performance Savings accounts.</p>

<p>The 360 Savings depositors said Capital One froze their rates at 0.3% while offering rates to 360 Performance Savings depositors that peaked at 4.35% early last year.
                   The higher-yielding account now yields 3.6%.</p>

<p>Under the settlement, Capital One will pay 360 Savings depositors $300 million to cover interest they could have received on 360 Performance Savings accounts.</p>

<p>It also will pay $125 million of additional interest to depositors who still have 360 Savings accounts.</p>

<p>The settlement covers depositors with 360 Savings accounts at any time since September 18, 2019.  Legal fees will be paid from the settlement.</p>

<p>Capital One, based in McLean, Virginia, did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing to settle.  It did not immediately respond to requests for comment outside business hours.</p>

<p>The U.S.  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau filed a similar lawsuit in January before President Donald Trump took office,

        excerpt: 'Carrier Announces Additional $1 Billion Investment in U.S Manufacturing Footprint, Advanced Cutting-Edge R&D and Workforce Expansion',
        content: `<p>In addition to its ongoing commitments to American operations, Carrier Global Corporation (NYSE: CARR), a global leader in intelligent climate and energy solutions, today announced plans to invest an additional $1 billion over five years in U.S. manufacturing, innovation, and workforce expansion.</p>

<p>Carrier Chairman and CEO David Gitlin stated, "This investment marks the next chapter in our commitment to U.S. manufacturing."</p>
<p>"We are building for the future by creating high-quality, skilled trade careers and empowering American workers to lead the next generation of manufacturing.</p>

<p> At the same time, it positions Carrier to capture the tremendous growth ahead in our industry and deliver smart, differentiated solutions for our customers."</p>

<p>The additional investment will fund the expansion of existing facilities and construction of a new state-of-the-art manufacturing site to support the production of highly engineered components for heat pumps and battery assemblies - both essential to Carrier's Home Energy Management System (HEMS).</p>
<p>It will also accelerate next-generation R&D, including innovations in liquid cooling for data centers and battery-enabled climate solutions technologies developed under Carrier Energy, the company's bold, in-house start up focused on optimizing home energy use and supporting grid flexibility.</p>
<p>Carrier's TechVantage initiative, announced in January, is included in both the $1 billion investment and anticipated 4,000 jobs.</p>
<p>The program aims to hire 1,000 U.S. service technicians and train more than 100,000 climate solutions service and sales professionals over the next five years.</p>
<p>This effort is focused on developing the skilled workforce needed to support the installation and servicing of high-performance climate solutions systems.</p>

<p>Based in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, Carrier is the largest U.S.-headquartered company in its industry and continues to invest in its American operations to strengthen manufacturing capabilities and drive long-term growth.</p>

<p>Over the past five years, the company has grown its U.S. workforce by approximately 20 percent, reinforcing its long-standing commitment to American manufacturing, innovation and economic growth.</p>`,

        title: 'ZeroAvia, a clean-aircraft startup',
        excerpt: 'ZeroAvia is working on a new funding round to raise approximately $150 million as it moves closer to commercializing its first hydrogen fuel-cell engine',
        content: `<p>The company is in discussions with strategic and financial investors for the Series D funding, Chief Executive Officer Val Miftakhov said in an interview.</p>
<p>He aims to identify a lead investor on the round, which has been under way for about six weeks, by the Paris Air Show in mid-June</p>
<p>“This round will take us all the way to the end of ’28,” Miftakhov said.  The company is likely to need further incremental funding, but once it starts shipping products “we can also go IPO.”</p>

<h2>ZeroAvia</h2>
<p>This week, ZeroAvia announced a launch customer for its initial engine, the ZA600.  UK cargo-services firm RVL Aviation plans to operate a Cessna Grand Caravan retrofitted with the hydrogen-electric powertrain on flights within the British Isles. </p>
<p>The US Federal Aviation Administration, which is in charge of the electric motor, and the UK Civil Aviation Authority, which is evaluating the hydrogen fuel cell system, are coordinating certification.</p>

<p>The company is on track to start commercial operations by late next year or early 2027, Miftakhov said.</p>
<p>There are about 1,000 Cessna Caravans in service in the configuration that will receive the first approvals, an addressable market that could expand to about 3,000, he said. </p>
<p>He added that the current funding round should be sufficient for the ZA600 program to reach positive cash flow. </p>
<p>Before moving on to providing engines for brand-new aircraft, the company has been collaborating with operators, aircraft manufacturers, and others in the sector to enter the engine-replacement market first.</p>

<p>Miftakhov, who has reached tentative deals to supply American Airlines Group Inc., United Airlines Holdings Inc. and Alaska Air Group Inc. with engines for their regional turboprops,
    sees ZeroAvia becoming a disruptor in an aircraft-engine industry dominated by a handful of players,
    including Pratt & Whitney, Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc, General Electric Co. and Safran SA. </p>


<p>Its approach has been to start small — a Cessna aircraft that can be configured to seat up to 14 passengers — before moving into higher-capacity aircraft.  Its next engine, the ZA2000, is aimed at turboprops seating up to 80 passengers.</p>

<h2>Prior Rounds</h2>
<p>ZeroAvia, which is based in the US but has about 200 of its 300 employees in the UK, has raised about $300 million, including prior equity rounds and grants.</p>
<p>The hydrogen-aviation sector has seen numerous setbacks in recent months — competitor Universal Hydrogen folded last year, and planemaker Airbus SE has pushed back its timeline for making a hydrogen-powered commercial airliner,
                      dealing a major blow to efforts to build infrastructure like airport facilities and green-hydrogen fuel production.  </p>


<p>In the meantime, the political outlook has become less friendly to clean tech in the US under President Donald Trump, and Europe is shifting money from green projects toward the defense sector. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, Miftakhov said ZeroAvia has benefited from having a less-cluttered field. </p>
<p>The company was selected earlier this year a US Air Force grant to study integrating hydrogen propulsion into Cessna aircraft alongside autonomous technology.</p>
<p>“I don’t think there is a significant doubt that we are going to electrify aviation,” Miftakhov said.</p>
<p>“It starts with small aircraft, but it goes larger and larger.”</p>`,

        title: 'The Future of Digital Finance is Customer-Centric',
        excerpt: 'As we move deeper into the digital age, one trend in the financial services industry stands out above the rest: the shift toward customer-centricity.',
        content: `<p>Gone are the days when banks and financial institutions operated as gatekeepers with limited access points and generic services. </p>
<p>Today, empowered by technology and driven by consumer expectations, the future of digital finance is being shaped around the individual — their needs, their behaviors, and their experiences</p>
<h2>From Institution-Focused to Customer-First</h2>
<p>Traditional finance was built on rigid systems designed primarily for operational efficiency and regulatory compliance. </p>
<p>Customers had to conform to the structure — limited service hours, complex paperwork, and impersonal interactions.</p>

<p>However, the rise of digital platforms has flipped the script. With fintech innovation, mobile banking, AI, and blockchain, users now expect seamless, personalized, and on-demand financial experiences.</p>
<p>Financial providers are being pushed to transform. It’s not enough to offer digital access; institutions must understand customers holistically, anticipate their needs, and deliver tailored solutions in real time. </p>
<p>In this new paradigm, success hinges on delivering value-driven experiences rather than merely transactional services.</p>

<h2>Data as New Currency</h2>
<p>One of the key enablers of customer-centric finance is data.</p>
<p>From transaction histories and behavioral patterns to lifestyle choices and social signals, today’s financial systems can gather unprecedented amounts of customer data.</p>
<p>The intelligent use of this data — with privacy and ethics at the forefront — allows companies to deliver hyper-personalized experiences.</p>
<p>Machine learning and AI tools now predict spending habits, recommend savings plans, detect fraud proactively, and even offer tailored investment advice.</p>
<p>These smart, data-driven insights transform the user from a passive recipient to an active participant in their financial journey.</p>

<h2>OmniChannel Engagemnt & UX</h2>
<p>In a truly customer-centric digital finance ecosystem, the experience must be seamless across platforms — mobile apps, websites, ATMs, or customer service centers. </p>
<p>Users expect continuity, speed, and convenience.</p>
<p>Fintech startups have raised the bar with intuitive interfaces and delightful user experiences. As a result, traditional banks are investing heavily in UX design, mobile-first development, and API integration with third-party platforms.</p>
<p>The goal? To meet customers wherever they are — physically and digitally.</p>

<h2>Financial Inclusion and Accessibility</h2>
<p>A customer-centric future must also address accessibility. Digital finance opens the door to underserved populations, especially in developing regions. </p>
<p>Mobile wallets, digital lending platforms, and biometric authentication are bringing financial services to individuals who were historically excluded.</p>
<p>By designing products with inclusivity in mind — simple interfaces, vernacular language options, 
                  low-bandwidth solutions — digital finance can empower entire communities and bridge socioeconomic gaps.</p>

<h2>Trust & Transparency</h2>
<p>Customer-centricity also means prioritizing trust. With growing concerns about data security, identity theft, and algorithmic bias, institutions must be transparent in how they operate. </p>
<p>Customers want to know: </p>
<ul>
<li>- How their data is used.</li>
<li>- What protections are in place.</li>
<li>- Whether AI decisions are fair and explainable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Building digital trust will be a competitive advantage in the years ahead. </p>
<p>It requires clear communication, strong cybersecurity, and ethical governance frameworks.</p>

<h2>The Role of Human Touch in a Digital World </h2>
<p>While automation and AI drive efficiency, the human element remains vital.</p>
<p>Financial decisions — from mortgages to retirement planning — are deeply personal. The future of digital finance lies in augmenting human interaction with technology, not replacing it.</p>
<p>Digital platforms that allow users to quickly access human advisors, receive empathetic support, or get customized advice will stand out. </p>
<p>The ideal blend is a hybrid model: intelligent automation with easy access to human expertise when needed.</p>

<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>The transformation toward a customer-centric financial future is not optional — it’s imperative. Financial institutions that embrace this shift will unlock new levels of loyalty, engagement, and long-term growth.</p>
<p>Those that resist will be left behind.</p>
<p>In this future, success won't be defined by the number of branches or even the size of an institution's balance sheet.</p>
<p>Instead, it will be measured by how well an organization understands, serves, and evolves with its customers.</p>

<p>Digital finance is no longer about digitizing old systems — it’s about reimagining finance around people.</p>`,

        title: '2025 Could easily be Nintendos Year',
        excerpt: ' If you squinted, you could see a shadow that looked a little bit like Florida over 2025.',
        content: `<p>Naturally, that was the specter of GTA 6, which was originally scheduled to launch later this year but was moved to next year, on May 26, 2026.</p>
<p>The year could have been completely dominated by Rockstar's next epic, but the skies have cleared to let another giant release take 2025 as its own - the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<h2>Nintendo Switch 2</h2>

<p>Nintendo needs to make this first year of Switch 2 really matter if it wants to win in 2025. Even when you take into account major releases like Death Stranding 2, Elden Ring Nightreign, Borderlands 4, and, dare I say it, Hollow Knight: Silksong, Nintendo's new console is now the biggest launch of 2025 by quite a bit. However, with just one major launch game, the remainder of 2025 will need to be counted.</p>

<h2>Pole position</h2>


<p>Switch 2 is starting strong, launching hand-in-hand with potentially the best ever Mario Kart game yet in Mario Kart World on June 5. </p>

<p>Its introduction of open-world exploration, evolution of Grand Prix races, and brand new, brilliantly chaotic Knockout Tours means that it's going to be the game everyone is talking about and sharing across their social media in June. </p>

<p>If it's got the staying power that Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has had (it's still one of the best-selling games of all time and the best-selling Switch game), the Switch 2 is out the starting gate with a bang.
                       But then, before you know it, we're into July where Nintendo has already scheduled our second big release for Switch 2 in Donkey Kong: Bananza.  Despite the brain ache it gives me every time trying to get the Bananza spelling right, this is exciting territory for DK.</p>



<p>It's the first 3D Donkey Kong game for 26 years (the last being Donkey Kong 64 on the N64) and from what I've played at the Switch 2 preview event, it feels like DK being given the Super Mario Odyssey treatment, to the point that if you switched out the ape for our old plumber pal you could argue it's essentially Super Mario Odyssey 2 in all but name.</p>

<p>While DK's next outing isn't launching day one but on July 17, it is arriving in what we call the launch window for Switch 2, and provides an excellent excitement build just over a month after the console's debut.</p>

<p>That's two big exclusives within as many months for Switch 2.  And that's without even noting the big event that's happening between those two dates.</p>

<p>Summer Game Fest, the big June gaming industry event that's now emerged victorious from the remains of E3, is running from June 6 - 10, and usually Nintendo takes its usual slot on the Tuesday (this year being June 10) to drop a livestreamed Nintendo Direct.</p>

<p>It hasn't announced one yet for this year, but it's also not unlike Nintendo to drop such an event with 24-48 hours' notice.</p>


<h2>Closing The Year</h2>

<p>We have two major, undated Switch 2 exclusives that are due to launch in 2025 that may get release dates during an SGF presentation.  Knowing when Metroid Prime 4: Beyond and Pokemon Legends: Z-A will arrive for Nintendo Switch 2 will outline the agenda for the Switch 2's first year as - hopefully - continued critically-acclaimed exclusives.</p>

<p>There are also titles like Kirby Air Riders, Drag x Drive, and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment still to come in 2025 that are also currently dateless and exclusive to Switch 2.  Again, they're really bolstering this first year line-up for the Switch 2 and only aiding the idea that this year could well be dominated by Nintendo releases.</p>

<p>With GTA 6 now set to take over 2026, and with console exclusives for Xbox and PlayStation currently being a little scarce beyond the likes of The Outer Worlds 2 and Ghost of Yotei (at least so far), 2025 really is Nintendo's.</p>

<p>From the outline we have already for releases, it already feels like Switch 2 is the console to have in 2025.</p>

<p>If Nintendo can keep up with what it's already promised, it's going to be quite the first year for Switch 2.</p>`,

        title: 'Nintendo is  Switch 2 Here',
        excerpt: 'The Nintendo Switch 2 is real and its launching in June',
        content: `<p> After literally years of unverified rumors, dubious leaks and copious amounts of online speculation, Nintendo revealed its next-generation console, and it’s the Switch sequel the majority expected (and many of us wanted).</p>


<p>First announced back in January and then fully unveiled at the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct event in April along with 22 launch games, the Switch 2 is an evolution of the existing Nintendo Switch console rather than a reinvention of the wheel.</p>

<p>On the surface, the Nintendo Switch 2 looks largely identical to its predecessor, but there is one key difference: Switch 2 is bigger!
                 In the handheld world, bigger is increasingly meaning better, with chunky units like Steam Deck OLED ruling supreme, and Nintendo is following the trend.  Prepare your pockets because the Nintendo Switch 2 isn’t a slim device.</p>

<p>In the original Switch 2 reveal trailer, Nintendo cleverly showcased the Switch 2’s increased size by comparing it with the current Switch.  It will sport a larger display size and thinner bezels.</p>

<p>Another noticeable design tweak is the new kickstand.  It will cover the entire back of the console and is adjustable so you can view the display from multiple angles.  It’s a huge leap from the regular Switch’s restrictive (and flimsy) kickstand but comparable with the kickstand added to the Nintendo Switch OLED model in 2021.</p>


<p>One of the big Nintendo Switch 2 rumors was the addition of a mysterious “C button.”  Yesterday, a brief video was uploaded to the Nintendo Today app. But now, during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, Nintendo has officially unveiled this button, which works with the new GameChat feature.</p>

<p>The system's new chat system can be accessed by pressing the C button on the right joystick. The menu in question appears very similar to the one you’d see on Discord, with each player’s camera showing up as tiles on the screen.</p>


<p>Speaking of the Joy-Cons, Nintendo also showed off mouse-like controls for its controllers.  The control scheme mirrors how a PC mouse works, where you put both Joy-cons on a table or surface and roll them to control whatever is on the screen.</p>


<p> There are also elements of motion controls similar to what we've already seen on the original Nintendo Switch, where you can jerk your wrist with the controller in-hand to toss a ball, or something similar.</p>
<p>At a glance, there might not appear to be much new, but Switch 2’s Joy-Cons won’t just be bigger, but they will also connect to the console in a new way.  The railing system is out, and instead, a new connection method has been implemented.</p>


<p>The Switch 2’s reveal video showcases this change and the way the Joy-Cons snap onto the Switch 2’s main console unit sure does look satisfying.</p>

<p>In docked mode, the Switch 2 can hit up to 4K (3840 x 2160) resolution at 60 frames per second.  It also supports 120 fps when 1920x1080 or 2560x1440 resolutions are selected.  The system supports HDR10 and a 1920x1080 resolution in tabletop mode and handheld mode, following screen resolution.</p>

<p>The Switch 2 also ships with a redesigned dock.  The new dock features softer, rounded edges, and more of the display is visible when docked — whether this will be used for gameplay features remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Nintendo says the Switch 2 will have up to 6.5 hours of battery life, depending on what games you're playing.  The system will sport a pair of USB-C ports.</p>

<p>The original Nintendo Switch didn’t have the same voice chat functionality as the PS5 and Xbox Series X.  Because of that, the new GameChat feature is one of the most important features coming to Nintendo’s console.  Here’s how it works.
                           The GameChat overlay looks like the Discord chat overlay.  A small microphone on top of the console picks up your voice, even from a distance.</p>


<p>Nintendo says there’s noise canceling, so you won’t have to worry if you’re playing in a noisy environment.  And as seen in the video, it appears you can press the C button to mute yourself.  This works whether you’re in handheld or docked mode.</p>

<p>There are other functions similar to PS5.  You’ll be able to chat across different games, view another player’s screen, and share your screen.  You can even use the brand-new Nintendo Switch 2 camera while gaming. As expected, the Nintendo Switch 2 will support a slew of accessories.</p>


<p>Most notably, we were introduced to GameChat, Nintendo's new in-game chat system.  This incorporates the all-new peripheral, the Switch 2 Camera, which can add your friendly face to multiplayer sessions or even incorporate your image into select titles like Super Mario Party Jamboree.</p>



<p>Price info for all the new Nintendo Switch 2 accessories, including controllers, carry cases, and peripherals, has now been confirmed on the official Nintendo website.</p>

<p>You can find a full list below:</p>
<ul>
<li>strong>Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller: $79.99 ($10 more than the original Pro Controller RRP)</strong></li>
<li>strong>Joy-Con 2 controllers: $89.99 ($10 more than original Joy-Con pairs)</strong></li>
<li>strong>Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip: $34.99</strong></li>
<li>strong>Joy-Con 2 Strap: $12.99</strong></li>
<li>strong>Joy-Con 2 Wheel (set of two): $19.99</strong></li>
<li>strong>Nintendo Switch 2 Camera: $49.99</strong></li>

<li>strong>Nintendo Switch 2 All-in-One Carry Case: $79</strong></li>
<li>strong>Nintendo Switch 2 AC Adapter: $29 (same as original Switch)</strong></li>
<ul>

<p>Overall, the new peripherals aren't much more expensive than they already were.</p>

<p>While the system might appear similar to its predecessor, its strength lies in its refinement and an impressive assortment of first and third-party games.</p>

<p>Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders will begin on Wednesday, April 9 in the US.  The standalone Nintendo Switch 2 console will cost $449 / AU$699 / £395. </p>

<p>Alternatively, there will be a Switch 2 bundle that includes a digital copy of Mario Kart World for $499 / AU$769 / £429.  The Nintendo Switch 2 will be widely available starting June 5th.</p>

<p>In the U.S., retailers such as Amazon and Best Buy are already sold out of pre-orders but we're tracking restocks on our live blog.</p>


<p>Best Buy is letting shoppers register interest to receive information about new restocks.</p>`,

        content: `<p>With this earlier-than-usual number update to Android, Google is focusing mostly on under-the-hood improvements and practical improvements.</p>

<p>Private Space and partial screen recording were added to Android 15, despite the fact that the update's visual improvements received little attention. This year, too, Google doesn’t seem too keen to focus much on a radical aesthetic overhaul.
   If you are curious about the update, here is everything you must know about Android 16, including when it will be available, which devices already have it, and which features are likely to make it to the final release.</p>

<h2>Android 16 developer</h2>

<p>Google released the Android 16 developer previews and beta months ahead of the usual schedule.  As such, Android 16 beta 3 is already live, and we have already reached the “Platform Stability” stage, suggesting Google is only making final touch-up and fixing bugs rather than testing new features.</p>
<p>This time period is for app developers to make changes. Based on the time release timeline, we expect the stable version of Android 16 to arrive sometime after April.</p>
<p>There is no better time than Google's annual developer conference, Google I/O, which will begin on May 20 this year, even though we do not have any official statements.</p>
<p>Android 16 is currently only available on Pixel phones made by Google, starting with the Pixel 6 and up. Although the list may expand over the coming weeks, these phones currently support Android 16 beta if you would to try:</p>

        title: 'Revolutionary AI Breakthrough: New Neural Network Architecture Achieves Human-Level Reasoning',
        excerpt: 'Scientists have developed a groundbreaking neural network that demonstrates unprecedented reasoning capabilities, marking a significant milestone in artificial intelligence research.',
        content: `<p>In a landmark achievement for artificial intelligence research, scientists at leading tech companies have unveiled a revolutionary neural network architecture that demonstrates human-level reasoning capabilities across multiple domains.</p>

<p>The new system, dubbed "ReasonNet," represents a significant departure from traditional transformer-based models. Instead of relying solely on pattern recognition, ReasonNet incorporates advanced logical reasoning mechanisms that allow it to understand cause-and-effect relationships, make inferences, and solve complex problems through step-by-step analysis.</p>

<h2>Key Innovations</h2>

<p>The breakthrough centers around three major innovations:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Dynamic Memory Architecture:</strong> Unlike static models, ReasonNet can dynamically allocate and reorganize its memory structures based on the complexity of the problem at hand.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Modal Reasoning:</strong> The system seamlessly integrates text, images, and numerical data to form comprehensive understanding and make informed decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Explainable AI Components:</strong> Every decision made by ReasonNet can be traced back through its reasoning process, providing unprecedented transparency in AI decision-making.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Real-World Applications</h2>

<p>Early testing has shown remarkable results across various fields:</p>

<p>In medical diagnosis, ReasonNet has demonstrated the ability to analyze complex cases involving multiple symptoms and medical history, providing diagnostic suggestions that match specialist-level accuracy. The system doesn't just identify patterns but explains its reasoning process, helping doctors understand the logic behind each recommendation.</p>

<p>Financial institutions are already exploring applications in risk assessment and fraud detection. The AI's ability to understand causal relationships makes it particularly effective at identifying sophisticated fraud schemes that might escape traditional detection methods.</p>

<h2>Implications for the Future</h2>

<p>This breakthrough represents more than just an incremental improvement in AI capabilities. It signals a fundamental shift toward artificial intelligence that can truly understand and reason about the world, rather than simply recognizing patterns in data.</p>

<p>As we move forward, the implications are profound. We may be witnessing the birth of AI systems that can engage in genuine problem-solving, collaborate meaningfully with humans, and tackle complex challenges that require deep understanding and reasoning.</p>`,

        title: 'The Nuclear Company is taking an old approach to building new nuclear reactors',
        excerpt: 'Rather than gin up a new design or try to mass manufacture smaller reactors, it wants to develop a series of reactors using existing designs',
        content: `<p>The two-year-old startup announced a Series A last month that included investments from CIV, Goldcrest Capital, MCJ Collective, True Ventures, and Wonder Ventures, though it did not disclose the amount raised.</p>

<p>Now, the company has secured $46.3 million in a Series A fundraise out of a targeted $51.3 million total,The details were published in an SEC filing.</p>
<p>The Nuclear Company was founded in 2023 by three serial entrepreneurs: former AppHarvest CEO Jonathan Webb, Arcadia CEO Kiran Bhatraju, and CIV CEO Patrick Maloney.  The startup is prioritizing sites that already have permits or licenses to operate.  According to Nuclear Regulatory Commission filings for combined operating licenses and early site permits, less than a dozen sites fall under that category.</p>
<p>At the sites that are closer to groundbreaking, each can support reactors with more than 1 gigawatt of generation capacity.  The Nuclear Company is aiming to develop 6 gigawatts in its first fleet.</p>
<p> The funding round arrives as tech companies and utilities are struggling to secure power for data centers.  Demand for electricity in the U.S. is expected to surge nearly 16% by 2029, according to Grid Strategies, after years of steady consumption.  Data centers are a large driver; their electricity use could quadruple by the end of the decade.</p>

<p>In the face of potential power shortages, tech companies have been cozying up to nuclear startups and developers.  Google is working with Kairos to build 500 megawatts worth of small modular reactors (SMR), while Amazon participated in a massive $700 million round to fund X-energy’s SMR plans</p>
<p>Meta has solicited proposals from developers to build up to 4 gigawatts of generating capacity, and Microsoft is working with Constellation Energy to restart a reactor at Three Mile Island.</p>

<p>But nuclear power is facing headwinds, both expected and unexpected.  Competition from solar power is among the former: tech companies and data center operators have been snapping up capacity from solar farms, signing sizable deals.</p>

<p>These farms are frequently paired with massive batteries to provide 24/7 electricity.  The technology is inexpensive, and new projects can be developed in around 18 months.</p>

<p>Nuclear may soon face other financial hurdles, too.  This week, the House Ways and Means Committee published its draft of a reconciliation bill that would kill subsidies for nuclear power that were granted under the Inflation Reduction Act.</p>

<p> Nuclear power plants are currently eligible for tax credits up to $15 per megawatt-hour</p>
<p>Most new nuclear power plants, including those on The Nuclear Company’s timeline, aren’t expected to come online until the early 2030s.</p>
<p>Given that forecasts for the next five years vary wildly, massive nuclear plants entering service a decade from now could be stuck holding the bag.</p>

<p> The world is awash in data about, well, the world — thanks to satellites and environmental sensors.  But there’s still a lot we can’t see, and Fieldstone Bio thinks microbes can change that.
    “They’ve evolved to sense and respond to information.  It’s just trillions of calculations going on at all times all around us,” Brandon Fields, Fieldstone Bio’s co-founder and chief science officer, told TechCrunch.  “How do we take that and actually manipulate that to gain benefits for us?”</p>

<p>Fieldstone’s technology emerged from that question.  The startup was founded in 2023 after spinning out of MIT, where professor Chris Voigt’s lab had developed a way to turn microbes into sensors.<p>

<p>The scientists programmed the microbes to change color when they encountered something of interest, whether it be nutrients in soil or landmines hidden in the dirt, and then figured out how to detect them.
                   “The key technology out of Chris’ lab is this idea of, ‘How do we actually visualize these cells from really far away?’”  Fields said.</p>
<p> Fieldstone Bio recently raised $5 million in seed funding led by Ubiquity Ventures with participation from E14 and LDV Capital, the company exclusively told TechCrunch.  The startup has been testing its technology in the lab, and the funding will let it test those microbes in the real world.</p>
<p>Each strain is tailored to sense a particular compound, such as nitrogen on a farm field or TNT residue from a landmine. <br>
                   “We isolate microbes from the environments we want to sense,” Fields said. </p>

<p>“We build our sensors the DNA pieces, and we just drop them into these different ones and see which ones behave the best, which ones can last the longest.”</p>`,

        title: 'Trump floats possible new F-55 warplane and F-22 upgrade',
        excerpt: 'The United States is examining development of a twin-engined warplane to be known as the F-55, as well as an upgrade to its Lockheed Martin (LMT.N), opens new tab F-22 Raptor called the F-22 Super, U.S.',
        content: `<p>Trump was speaking at a meeting of business leaders including the heads of Boeing (BA.N), opens new tab and GE Aerospace (GE.N), opens new tab in Doha, a day after announcing a string of business deals including an order from Qatar for 160 Boeing commercial jets.</p>

<p>Despite macroeconomic challenges, the technology sector continues to attract investment as companies demonstrate strong fundamentals and innovative capabilities that position them well for future growth.</p>

<h2>New F-55 warplane and F-22 upgrade</h2>

<p>After losing out to Boeing to replace the F-22 superfighter, Trump appeared to echo Lockheed's talk of a "best value" alternative and referred to the F-55 as both an upgrade to the F-35 and a new development. He also highlighted the role of the new air dominance platform called the F-47, recently awarded to Boeing (BA.N), opens new tab, and said the United States was simultaneously looking at upgrading the stealth fighter that it is designed to replace, the F-22.</p>
<p>"We're going to do an F-55 and - I think, if we get the right price, we have to get the right price - that'll be two engines and a super upgrade on the F-35, and then we're going to do the F-22," Trump said.
                       "I think the most beautiful fighter jet in the world is the F-22 but we're going to do an F-22 Super and it'll be a very modern version of the F-22 fighter jet," he said.</p>

<p>He added, "We're going to be going with it pretty quickly." Trump last month awarded Boeing the contract for the F-47 - a replacement for the Lockheed F-22 stealth fighter featuring a crewed aircraft flanked by a cohort of drones and seen as America's most advanced or sixth-generation fighter.</p>
<p>Lockheed Martin, which lost out to Boeing in that Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) competition and was dropped from a separate contest for a new U.S.  Navy stealth jet, has said it is now looking at plans for a "fifth-generation-plus" fighter.</p>
<p>CEO James Taiclet told analysts last month that Lockheed was looking at ways of applying technology developed for its losing bid for the F-47 contract to the F-35, delivering 80% of the capability for half the cost.</p>

<p>He stated to analysts, "We're basically going to take the chassis and turn it into a Ferrari." A Lockheed spokeswoman said "We thank President Trump for his support of the F-35 and F-22 and will continue to work closely with the Administration to realize its vision for air dominance."</p>

<h2>NEW AIRCRAFT</h2>

<p>Lockheed is separately in the midst of a delayed technology and software upgrade for the existing generation of F-35 strike fighter to boost cockpit displays and processing power.</p>

<p>Analysts said it was not immediately clear how Trump's list of potential developments fitted into known programmes and spending plans, or the timing of existing programmes.</p>
<p>According to Nick Cunningham, an aerospace analyst with Agency Partners, the term "F-55" could also refer to the F/A-XX program, which was designed to take over for the United States. Navy's ageing Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet fleet with the service's own sixth-generation stealth fighter.</p>

<p>Reuters reported on Wednesday that the Navy and Congress are battling the administration to keep the plans moving forward. Announcement of a winning bidder had been expected as early as March.</p>

<p>Funding of the radar-evading F-22, which is designed to combat other fighters, has been fiercely debated for years as Congress blocked plans by the Air Force to speed up retirements to focus on the next generation blueprint that became the F-47.</p>

<p>Any significant upgrade to the out-of-production F-22 would be costly, while Trump's reference to two engines implies the F-55 would not be a straightforward derivative of the single-engined F-35 but imply an ambitious new platform, analysts said.</p>

<p>"Adding an engine to the F-35 makes it a new aircraft," UK-based defence analyst Francis Tusa said.</p>`,

        excerpt: 'Windsurf, a startup that develops popular AI tools for software engineers, announced the launch of its first family of AI software engineering models, or SWE-1 for short.',
        content: `<p>The startup says it trained its new family of AI models — SWE-1, SWE-1-lite, and SWE-1-mini — to be optimized for the “entire software engineering process,” not just coding.</p?
<p>The launch of Windsurf’s in-house AI models may come as a shock to some, given that OpenAI has reportedly closed a $3 billion deal to acquire Windsurf.  However, the launch of this model suggests that Windsurf is attempting to develop not only applications but also the models that power them.</p>
<h2>WindSurf</h2>

<p>According to Windsurf, SWE-1, the largest and most capable AI model of the bunch, performs competitively with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, and Gemini 2.5 Pro on internal programming benchmarks.  However, SWE-1 appears to fall short of frontier AI models, such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet, on software engineering tasks.</p>

<p>Windsurf says its SWE-1-lite and SWE-1-mini models will be available for all users on its platform, free or paid.  Meanwhile, SWE-1 will only be available to paid users.  Windsurf did not immediately announce pricing for its SWE-1 models but claims it’s cheaper to serve than Claude 3.5 Sonnet.</p>

<p>Windsurf is best known for tools that allow software engineers to write and edit code through conversations with an AI chatbot, a practice known as “vibe coding.”  Other popular vibe-coding startups include Cursor, the largest in the space, as well as Lovable. </p>

<p>The majority of these startups, including Windsurf, have traditionally powered their applications with AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. In a video announcing the SWE models, comments made by Windsurf’s Head of Research, Nicholas Moy, underscore Windsurf’s newest efforts to differentiate its approach.  “Today’s frontier models are optimized for coding, and they’ve made massive strides over the last couple of years,” says Moy.  “But they’re not enough for us … Coding is not software engineering.”</p>
<p>Windsurf notes in a blog post that while other models are good at writing code, they struggle to work between multiple surfaces — as programmers often do — such as terminals, IDEs, and the internet.</p>

<p>The startup says SWE-1 was trained using a new data model and a “training recipe that encapsulates incomplete states, long-running tasks, and multiple surfaces.”</p>`,

        excerpt: 'Carrier Announces Additional $1 Billion Investment in U.S Manufacturing Footprint, Advanced Cutting-Edge R&D and Workforce Expansion',
        content: `<p>In addition to its ongoing commitments to American operations, Carrier Global Corporation (NYSE: CARR), a global leader in intelligent climate and energy solutions, today announced plans to invest an additional $1 billion over five years in U.S. manufacturing, innovation, and workforce expansion.</p>

<p>Carrier Chairman and CEO David Gitlin stated, "This investment marks the next chapter in our commitment to U.S. manufacturing."</p>
<p>"We are building for the future by creating high-quality, skilled trade careers and empowering American workers to lead the next generation of manufacturing.</p>

<p> At the same time, it positions Carrier to capture the tremendous growth ahead in our industry and deliver smart, differentiated solutions for our customers."</p>

<p>The additional investment will fund the expansion of existing facilities and construction of a new state-of-the-art manufacturing site to support the production of highly engineered components for heat pumps and battery assemblies - both essential to Carrier's Home Energy Management System (HEMS).</p>
<p>It will also accelerate next-generation R&D, including innovations in liquid cooling for data centers and battery-enabled climate solutions technologies developed under Carrier Energy, the company's bold, in-house start up focused on optimizing home energy use and supporting grid flexibility.</p>
<p>Carrier's TechVantage initiative, announced in January, is included in both the $1 billion investment and anticipated 4,000 jobs.</p>
<p>The program aims to hire 1,000 U.S. service technicians and train more than 100,000 climate solutions service and sales professionals over the next five years.</p>
<p>This effort is focused on developing the skilled workforce needed to support the installation and servicing of high-performance climate solutions systems.</p>

<p>Based in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, Carrier is the largest U.S.-headquartered company in its industry and continues to invest in its American operations to strengthen manufacturing capabilities and drive long-term growth.</p>

<p>Over the past five years, the company has grown its U.S. workforce by approximately 20 percent, reinforcing its long-standing commitment to American manufacturing, innovation and economic growth.</p>`,

        title: 'ZeroAvia, a clean-aircraft startup',
        excerpt: 'ZeroAvia is working on a new funding round to raise approximately $150 million as it moves closer to commercializing its first hydrogen fuel-cell engine',
        content: `<p>The company is in discussions with strategic and financial investors for the Series D funding, Chief Executive Officer Val Miftakhov said in an interview.</p>
<p>He aims to identify a lead investor on the round, which has been under way for about six weeks, by the Paris Air Show in mid-June</p>
<p>“This round will take us all the way to the end of ’28,” Miftakhov said.  The company is likely to need further incremental funding, but once it starts shipping products “we can also go IPO.”</p>

<h2>ZeroAvia</h2>
<p>This week, ZeroAvia announced a launch customer for its initial engine, the ZA600.  UK cargo-services firm RVL Aviation plans to operate a Cessna Grand Caravan retrofitted with the hydrogen-electric powertrain on flights within the British Isles. </p>
<p>The US Federal Aviation Administration, which is in charge of the electric motor, and the UK Civil Aviation Authority, which is evaluating the hydrogen fuel cell system, are coordinating certification.</p>

<p>The company is on track to start commercial operations by late next year or early 2027, Miftakhov said.</p>
<p>There are about 1,000 Cessna Caravans in service in the configuration that will receive the first approvals, an addressable market that could expand to about 3,000, he said. </p>
<p>He added that the current funding round should be sufficient for the ZA600 program to reach positive cash flow. </p>
<p>Before moving on to providing engines for brand-new aircraft, the company has been collaborating with operators, aircraft manufacturers, and others in the sector to enter the engine-replacement market first.</p>

<p>Miftakhov, who has reached tentative deals to supply American Airlines Group Inc., United Airlines Holdings Inc. and Alaska Air Group Inc. with engines for their regional turboprops,
    sees ZeroAvia becoming a disruptor in an aircraft-engine industry dominated by a handful of players,
    including Pratt & Whitney, Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc, General Electric Co. and Safran SA. </p>


<p>Its approach has been to start small — a Cessna aircraft that can be configured to seat up to 14 passengers — before moving into higher-capacity aircraft.  Its next engine, the ZA2000, is aimed at turboprops seating up to 80 passengers.</p>

<h2>Prior Rounds</h2>
<p>ZeroAvia, which is based in the US but has about 200 of its 300 employees in the UK, has raised about $300 million, including prior equity rounds and grants.</p>
<p>The hydrogen-aviation sector has seen numerous setbacks in recent months — competitor Universal Hydrogen folded last year, and planemaker Airbus SE has pushed back its timeline for making a hydrogen-powered commercial airliner,
                      dealing a major blow to efforts to build infrastructure like airport facilities and green-hydrogen fuel production.  </p>


<p>In the meantime, the political outlook has become less friendly to clean tech in the US under President Donald Trump, and Europe is shifting money from green projects toward the defense sector. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, Miftakhov said ZeroAvia has benefited from having a less-cluttered field. </p>
<p>The company was selected earlier this year a US Air Force grant to study integrating hydrogen propulsion into Cessna aircraft alongside autonomous technology.</p>
<p>“I don’t think there is a significant doubt that we are going to electrify aviation,” Miftakhov said.</p>
<p>“It starts with small aircraft, but it goes larger and larger.”</p>`,

        title: 'The Future of Digital Finance is Customer-Centric',
        excerpt: 'As we move deeper into the digital age, one trend in the financial services industry stands out above the rest: the shift toward customer-centricity.',
        content: `<p>Gone are the days when banks and financial institutions operated as gatekeepers with limited access points and generic services. </p>
<p>Today, empowered by technology and driven by consumer expectations, the future of digital finance is being shaped around the individual — their needs, their behaviors, and their experiences</p>
<h2>From Institution-Focused to Customer-First</h2>
<p>Traditional finance was built on rigid systems designed primarily for operational efficiency and regulatory compliance. </p>
<p>Customers had to conform to the structure — limited service hours, complex paperwork, and impersonal interactions.</p>

<p>However, the rise of digital platforms has flipped the script. With fintech innovation, mobile banking, AI, and blockchain, users now expect seamless, personalized, and on-demand financial experiences.</p>
<p>Financial providers are being pushed to transform. It’s not enough to offer digital access; institutions must understand customers holistically, anticipate their needs, and deliver tailored solutions in real time. </p>
<p>In this new paradigm, success hinges on delivering value-driven experiences rather than merely transactional services.</p>

<h2>Data as New Currency</h2>
<p>One of the key enablers of customer-centric finance is data.</p>
<p>From transaction histories and behavioral patterns to lifestyle choices and social signals, today’s financial systems can gather unprecedented amounts of customer data.</p>
<p>The intelligent use of this data — with privacy and ethics at the forefront — allows companies to deliver hyper-personalized experiences.</p>
<p>Machine learning and AI tools now predict spending habits, recommend savings plans, detect fraud proactively, and even offer tailored investment advice.</p>
<p>These smart, data-driven insights transform the user from a passive recipient to an active participant in their financial journey.</p>

<h2>OmniChannel Engagemnt & UX</h2>
<p>In a truly customer-centric digital finance ecosystem, the experience must be seamless across platforms — mobile apps, websites, ATMs, or customer service centers. </p>
<p>Users expect continuity, speed, and convenience.</p>
<p>Fintech startups have raised the bar with intuitive interfaces and delightful user experiences. As a result, traditional banks are investing heavily in UX design, mobile-first development, and API integration with third-party platforms.</p>
<p>The goal? To meet customers wherever they are — physically and digitally.</p>

<h2>Financial Inclusion and Accessibility</h2>
<p>A customer-centric future must also address accessibility. Digital finance opens the door to underserved populations, especially in developing regions. </p>
<p>Mobile wallets, digital lending platforms, and biometric authentication are bringing financial services to individuals who were historically excluded.</p>
<p>By designing products with inclusivity in mind — simple interfaces, vernacular language options, 
                  low-bandwidth solutions — digital finance can empower entire communities and bridge socioeconomic gaps.</p>

<h2>Trust & Transparency</h2>
<p>Customer-centricity also means prioritizing trust. With growing concerns about data security, identity theft, and algorithmic bias, institutions must be transparent in how they operate. </p>
<p>Customers want to know: </p>
<ul>
<li>- How their data is used.</li>
<li>- What protections are in place.</li>
<li>- Whether AI decisions are fair and explainable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Building digital trust will be a competitive advantage in the years ahead. </p>
<p>It requires clear communication, strong cybersecurity, and ethical governance frameworks.</p>

<h2>The Role of Human Touch in a Digital World </h2>
<p>While automation and AI drive efficiency, the human element remains vital.</p>
<p>Financial decisions — from mortgages to retirement planning — are deeply personal. The future of digital finance lies in augmenting human interaction with technology, not replacing it.</p>
<p>Digital platforms that allow users to quickly access human advisors, receive empathetic support, or get customized advice will stand out. </p>
<p>The ideal blend is a hybrid model: intelligent automation with easy access to human expertise when needed.</p>

<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>The transformation toward a customer-centric financial future is not optional — it’s imperative. Financial institutions that embrace this shift will unlock new levels of loyalty, engagement, and long-term growth.</p>
<p>Those that resist will be left behind.</p>
<p>In this future, success won't be defined by the number of branches or even the size of an institution's balance sheet.</p>
<p>Instead, it will be measured by how well an organization understands, serves, and evolves with its customers.</p>

<p>Digital finance is no longer about digitizing old systems — it’s about reimagining finance around people.</p>`,

        content: `<p>macOS Tahoe 26 introduces a beautiful new design, additional Continuity experiences, along with even more features to turbocharge productivity.</p>
<p>Apple today previewed the next major macOS release — macOS Tahoe 26 — which introduces a stunning new design and powerful capabilities that enable users to get even more done.</p>
<p>With the new design, iconic elements of macOS will feel more expressive, delightful, and personal while remaining instantly familiar, including the desktop, Dock, in-app navigation, and toolbars.</p>
<p>Users can further personalize the experience with an updated Control Center and new color options for folders, app icons, and widgets.</p>
<p>Continuity gets even better with the Phone app arriving on Mac, so users can access familiar features from iPhone — including Recents, Contacts, and Voicemails — and new ones like Call Screening1 and Hold Assist.2 Spotlight gets its biggest update ever, allowing users to now directly execute hundreds of actions — like sending an email or creating a note — and take advantage of all-new browsing experiences to get to content faster.</p>
<p>“macOS is the heart and soul of the Mac, and with Tahoe, we’re building on what users love most. Whether you’re a power user or just getting started on Mac, there’s something for everyone, with even more features to turbocharge productivity and make working across Mac and iPhone more seamlessly than ever before,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering.</p>
<p>“With its gorgeous new design, amazing Continuity with the Phone app, powerful enhancements to Spotlight, more intelligent shortcuts, and updates to Apple Intelligence, the Mac experience is better than ever.”</p>
<p>The new design unlocks even more ways to personalize the Mac.</p>


<h2>A Gorgeous New Design</h2>
<p>The gorgeous new design enhances the Mac experience in new ways, while maintaining the familiarity of macOS. </p>
<p>It is crafted with Liquid Glass, a translucent new material that reflects and refracts its surroundings. The Dock, sidebars, and toolbars have been refined, bringing greater focus to a user’s content.</p>
<p>The menu bar is now completely transparent, making the display feel even larger. There are more ways to customize what controls appear in the menu bar and Control Center, along with how they’re laid out.</p>
<p>The new design also unlocks more personalization on the Mac. App icons come to life in light or dark appearances, colorful new light and dark tints, as well as an elegant new clear look. </p>
<p>Users can also change the colors of folders and add a symbol or emoji to give them a unique identity.</p>
<p>And when combined with personalized wallpapers and theme colors, it’s easier than ever to make Mac a seamless extension of a user’s style.</p>
<p>The new design elevates iconic elements of macOS, making them at once fresh and timelessly Mac. From the moment a user unlocks their Mac, the desktop is instantly familiar.</p>

<h2>Continuity gets even better with the Phone App on Mac</h2>
<p>The Phone app arrives on Mac thanks to Continuity, which lets users relay cellular calls from their nearby iPhone.</p>
<p>The Phone app on Mac has the familiar features of the Phone app on iPhone — including Recents, Favorites, and Voicemails — and the latest updates like Call Screening and Hold Assist.</p>
<p>Call Screening automatically answers calls from unknown numbers and asks the caller for information so a user can decide whether or not to answer.</p>
<p>And when a user is stuck on hold, Hold Assist allows them to keep their spot in line while they wait for a live agent, so users can continue working on their Mac.</p>
<p>With the new Phone app for Mac, users can conveniently access familiar content — like Recents, Contacts, and Voicemail — synced from iPhone, and easily make a call with a click.</p>


<h2>The Biggest Update Ever to Spotlight</h2>
<p>Spotlight, the central place to search for things on Mac, makes finding what users are looking for easier than ever, and provides users with all-new ways to take action.</p>
<p>During a search, all results — including files, folders, events, apps, messages, and more — are now listed together and ranked intelligently based on relevance to the user. </p>
<p>New filtering options rapidly narrow searches to exactly what a user is looking for, like PDFs or Mail messages. </p>
<p>Spotlight can also surface results for documents stored on third-party cloud drives. And when a user doesn’t know exactly what they’re searching for, Spotlight’s new browse views make it easy to scan through their apps, files, clipboard history, and more.</p>
<p>All of a user’s apps are now on view in Spotlight.</p>
<p>Users can now take hundreds of actions directly from Spotlight — like sending an email, creating a note, or playing a podcast — without jumping between apps.</p>
<p>Users can now take hundreds of actions directly from Spotlight — like sending an email, creating a note, or playing a podcast — without jumping between apps.</p>
<p>Users can take actions from both Apple apps and apps built by developers, because any app can provide actions to Spotlight using the App Intents API. </p>
<p>Users can also run shortcuts and perform actions from the menu bar in the app they’re currently working in, all without lifting their hands off the keyboard.</p>
<p>Spotlight learns from users’ routines across the system and surfaces personalized actions, such as sending a message to a colleague a user regularly talks to.</p>
<p>Additionally, Spotlight introduces quick keys, which are short strings of characters that get users right to the action they’re looking for.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Items from the menu bar for the app a user is currently working in are searchable in Spotlight.</li>
    <li>Spotlight introduces quick keys, which are short strings of characters that get users right to the action they’re looking for.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Brand-New Capabilities Powered by Apple Intelligence</h2>
<p>Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system that delivers helpful and relevant intelligence, gets even more capable while protecting users’ privacy at every step.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Seamless communication across language barriers with Live Translation:</strong>
        In Messages, Live Translation can automatically translate messages, so if a user is making plans with new friends while traveling abroad, their message can be translated as they type and delivered in the recipient’s preferred language.
        And when the user receives a response, each text can be instantly translated.4 On FaceTime, a user can follow along with translated live captions while still hearing the speaker’s voice.
        And when a user is on a call in the Phone app, their words are translated for the recipient as they speak.
        This is enabled by Apple-built models that run entirely on device, so conversations stay private.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Shortcuts get more intelligent:</strong> A whole new class of intelligent actions lets users create shortcuts that are more powerful than ever, including summarizing text with Writing Tools and creating images with Image Playground.
        And now users will be able to tap directly into Apple Intelligence models, either on-device or with Private Cloud Compute, to generate responses that feed into the rest of their shortcut, maintaining the privacy of information used.
        For example, a student can build a shortcut that uses Apple Intelligence models to compare an audio transcription of a class lecture to the notes they took, and add any key points they may have missed.
        Users can also choose to tap into ChatGPT for its broad world knowledge and expertise.
        Additionally, users can now run shortcuts automatically on macOS, such as at a specific time of day, or when taking a specific action like saving a file to a folder or connecting a display.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Updates to Genmoji and Image Playground:</strong>macOS Tahoe brings new ways to create Genmoji, giving users the ability to start with existing emoji and descriptions, modify personal attributes like hair length or accessories, and select expressions based on the moment.
        Users will also have more control of personal attributes and expressions in Image Playground, and can tap into brand-new styles with ChatGPT, like an oil painting style or vector art.
        For moments when users have a specific idea in mind, they can tap Any Style and describe exactly what they want.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Increased productivity with Reminders:</strong>Apple Intelligence can review an email, website, note, or other content on Mac to find the most relevant action items. 
        And users can also choose to use Apple Intelligence to automatically categorize Reminders into sections to make them more manageable.
        Live Translation on FaceTime helps users communicate across languages by following along with translated live captions while still hearing the speaker’s voice.
    </li>
</ul>

        title: 'iOS 26 brings a major design overhaul with Liquid Glass, a new design language that introduces translucent controls, refractions, and fluid animations.',
        excerpt: 'The update also introduces Apple Intelligence, enabling on-device translation for calls and messages, AI suggestions in Reminders, Genmoji, Image Playground, visual intelligence via screenshots, and new Foundation Models framework for developers. ',
        content: `<p>Your iPhone and iPad will look significantly different when iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 roll out this fall. And no, you haven’t missed seven operating system upgrades since iOS 18 last year. Apple has changed the naming structure of its OS updates and made them all consistent—visionOS 26, watchOS 26, macOS 26—so they’re now tied to the year after their launch, similar to what car makers do when debuting new models.</p>
<p>The main highlight across all of Apple’s updates announced at WWDC 2025 revolves around the new look and feel of the interface, a design language the company calls Liquid Glass.</p>
<p>Beyond that, several new features are coming to iOS, from live translation in messages and calls to the ability to search anything on your iPhone screen through Visual Intelligence. The Photos app is also getting its tabs back! </p>
<p>More significant are the updates to iPadOS, which will now support windowed apps that are resizable and can be tiled, bringing it closer to a desktop computing experience people have been waiting for.</p>

<h2>Top iOS 26 Features</h2>
<p>Let's take a look at the top new features in iOS 26. You can read more about it directly from Apple here.</p>

<h2>Liquid Glass and Lock Screen Changes</h2>
<p>Apple has a new design language for the iPhone, the first major visual overhaul in years, and it's called Liquid Glass.</p>
<p>It's very much like the Windows Aero theme from the Microsoft Vista days in 2006. </p>
<p>The interface acts like glass, so pulling down the lock screen feels like you're moving a pane of glass, and you can see how the apps interact around it.</p>
<p>There are even specular highlights on app icons that shift as the phone moves in your hand.</p>
<p>Apple has also added some newer animations that feel bouncy, not unlike some of the new animations in Android 16.</p>
<p>There's supposedly no change in performance or battery life to render these effects.</p>
<p>You can have the normal app icons with Liquid Glass, and you can even tint the apps just like last year.</p>
<p>But there's a new option for “Clear” app icons, and everything in the interface switches to that all-glass look.</p>

<p>Over on the lock screen, the time now adapts to the photo, stretching until it goes right behind the top of the subject for a depth effect.</p>
<p>Also, when new notifications come in, the subject in your photo shifts up so that the notifications don't block them.</p>
<p>There's also a new way to turn 2D photos into a 3D effect in the Photos app, and you can apply those to the lock screen.</p>


<h2>Call Screening and Phone App Redesign</h2>
<p>Taking a page from Google's Call Screen feature on Pixel phones, Apple has finally added its own version in iOS 26.</p>
<p>Once you enable Call Screening, it'll automatically answer calls from unknown callers in the background without alerting you. </p>
<p>Once the caller gives a reason for their call, your phone will ring, but you'll be able to see the response on the screen so you can decide whether you want to answer or not.</p>
<p>Just like Google's Hold for Me feature, Apple has a Hold Assist function that makes staying on hold more bearable.</p>
<p>If you're trying to reach a company but hear the dreaded hold music, you can turn this feature on and won't have to pay super close attention to your phone. </p>
<p>When the music is over and a live agent starts talking, you'll get a notification—handy if you need to wait more than 30 minutes just to reach a customer service rep.</p>
<p>These screening functions are also in the Messages and FaceTime app with an “Unknown Senders” tab. You can approve these numbers and they'll show up in your main Messages view, or mark them as spam. (Some will automatically be screened as Spam.)</p>
<p>The Phone app also has a new look, with your favorites up top and recent calls below. 
You'll be able to switch to the old Phone app user interface through a toggle on the top right of the app.
</p>


<h2>Live Translation in Messages, Phone, and FaceTime</h2>
<p>You can now get live translations from Apple's Messages, Phone, and FaceTime apps.</p>
<p>We've seen similar versions of this technology from Samsung and Google on their respective phones over the last few years. </p>
<p>In the Phone app, you can turn on a translation mode, and a voice will translate what the other person says and vice versa in real time.   (You can toggle whether you need translation both ways or just for one language.)</p>
<p>language.) Over in the Messages app, you'll see translated text as a part of your message bubble when speaking with someone else, and in FaceTime, you'll get real-time translated subtitles. </p>
<p> ll of these happen on-device, so data doesn't leave your iPhone, and they'll also work when you're communicating with people using Android phones.</p>
<p>At the moment, Live Translation in Phone and FaceTime only works with one-on-one calls in English (UK and US), French (France), German, Portuguese (Brazil), and Spanish (Spain).</p>
<p>Live Translation in Messages has slightly broader language support, including Chinese (simplified) and Japanese. </p>
<p>Since there's now a Phone app on iPadOS and MacOS, you can still take advantage of these features if you answer on those platforms.</p>

<h2>Visual Intelligence and the iPhone Screen</h2>
<p>Visual Intelligence debuted with Apple Intelligence as a way to have Siri understand the world around you through the iPhone's camera.</p>
<p>It's now expanding to understand the context of your iPhone's screen. </p>
<p>Very much like Google's Gemini, Visual Intelligence can identify what's on your screen and suggest specific actions.</p>
<p>Unlike triggering Visual Intelligence and Siri with the Camera Control or Action Button, to trigger the onscreen contextual mode, you have to take a screenshot (these don't have to be saved if you tap the X icon on the top left). </p>
<p>If you take a screenshot of an invitation someone sent you, for example, you'll see a suggestion to add it to your calendar with one tap.</p>
<p>If you're looking at a PDF, a screenshot might suggest a summarization so you can get the highlights.
</p>
<p>There's even a feature very similar to Google Lens or Google's Circle to Search, where you can take a screenshot and then highlight a specific thing on the page you want to search via Google, or through another app that's installed on your phone that supports the feature, like Etsy. </p>
<p>So you can highlight a vase, for example, and then find similar results via Google or similar shoppable vases on Etsy.</p>


<h2>New Group Message and Emoji Features</h2>
<p>Group chats are finally getting typing indicators and polls (though the latter is exclusive to iMessage group chats). </p>
<p>There's also the ability to add new background designs for messages to make them more personalized. </p>
<p>If you're big on emoji, you might like the new ability to mix two emojis together via Genmoji in the keyboard or in Apple's Image Playground app. (It's somewhat similar to Google's Emoji Kitchen.)</p>



<h2>A New Games App</h2>
<p>There's a new app in iOS 26!</p>
<p>The Games app is now your one-stop shop to see all the games you've ever bought on the App Store, and you can launch them right from this app.
    (There's even controller support so you can use a mobile controller to move through the user interface.)
</p>
<p>The app lets you discover new games, see what your friends are playing, and a Challenges tab lets you compete even with single-player games via a leaderboard.
</p>

<h2>Other Noteworthy Features</h2>
<p>There are several other features not mentioned here, but here are a few other highlights.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Photos:</strong>
        Apple heard your complaints about the Photos app and brought back the Library and Collections tabs on the main page of the app.
    </li>

    </li>
    <li><strong>AirPods Audio and Video Recording:</strong>
        If you have AirPods or AirPods Pro with the H2 chip, you can start recording a video in the iPhone's camera app by pressing and holding on the stem. 
        You can also record audio in high definition in the camera app with those AirPods.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Maps</strong>
        Maps will learn the routes you travel regularly and will give you a heads up about delays before you leave the house. 
    </li>

        In the Music app, there's now an AutoMix feature that will seamlessly mixes one song to the next like a DJ using tools like time stretching and beatmatching. 
        Also, if you're looking at music lyrics, you can now see translations.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Wallet</strong>
        Apple's Wallet app can create Digital IDs with your US passport, which can be used at TSA checkpoints, in apps, and in person.

        excerpt: 'Lets take a look at specific new capabilities coming to iPads this fall As always you can get a Multitasking Improvements',
        content: `<p>iPads have become incredibly powerful over the past few years, but multitasking has been lackluster, making them feel inadequate as laptop replacements.</p>
<p> That's changing now with the multitasking changes in iPadOS 26. Now apps support windowing, so you can have multiple apps on the screen in different sizes. Just resize them by dragging a corner of the app and arrange them wherever.</p>
<p>There are native window tiling options—a flick to the left or right will tile apps to the sides for easier split-screen, and you can even split apps into thirds or quarters.</p>
<p>The familiar traffic light buttons from macOS are also available now on apps, and if you press and hold them, you'll see more options to arrange apps with a tap.</p>
<p>Swipe up and hold and your apps will spread out in Exposé mode, and you'll be able to revisit your grouped apps later even if you switch to a full-screen app.</p>
<p>There's now also a menu bar you can pull down from the top in any app, though the available options will depend on the app.
</p>

<p>Best of all, iPadOS now lets you handle more tasks in the background.</p>
<p>Previously, if you were rendering a file in Final Cut, you'd have to keep it open for the render to complete. Now, that task can be done in the background, allowing you to switch to other apps for a true multitasking desktop experience.</p>

<h2>A Better Files App </h2>
<p>The Files app has a new design that offers up more info at a glance. </p>
<p>There are resizable columns, collapsible folders, and you can set default apps for opening specific file types.</p>
<p>You can also customize folders with different colors and emojis to make them visually distinct. Speaking of, you can put folders in the dock for speedier access.</p>


<h2>A Preview App Comes iPad </h2>
<p>Apple's Preview app from macOS is now available on iPadOS, allowing you to open, edit, and mark up PDFs or images.</p>
<p>It works with the Apple Pencil, making it great for filling out text fields and signing documents.</p>


<h2> Other Noteworthy Features </h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Phone</strong>
        There's now a dedicated Phone app on iPad. Calls made to your iPhone can be routed so you can answer from the iPad, and you'll be able to take advantage of new features like live translation and call screening, too.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Journal</strong>
        The Journal app, originally an iPhone-exclusive app, is now on iPadOS. It now supports the Apple Pencil, so you can make your journal feel even more personal with your own handwriting.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Audio Recording </strong>
        There's a new input chooser that lets you pick the right microphone for each app, handy if you're connecting external mics to the iPad.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Notes</strong>
        You can capture conversations from the Phone app as audio recordings with transcriptions.

        title: 'visionOS 26 introduces powerful new spatial experiences for Apple Vision Pro',
        excerpt: 'Widgets become spatial and anchor in a user’s space, Personas are more expressive and realistic, and new APIs unleash exciting opportunities for developers, creators, and enterprises.',
        content: `<p>Apple today previewed visionOS 26, an expansive update packed with groundbreaking spatial experiences and new features for Apple Vision Pro.</p>
<p>Everyday interactions become more immersive and personal, with widgets that integrate into a user’s space, spatial scenes that use generative AI to add stunning lifelike depth to photos, striking enhancements that make Personas feel more natural and familiar, and shared spatial experiences for Vision Pro users in the same room.</p>
<p>visionOS 26 also adds support for 180-degree, 360-degree, and wide field-of-view content from Insta360, GoPro, and Canon, while new enterprise APIs allow organizations to create spatial experiences unique to visionOS.</p>
<p>And with support for PlayStation VR2 Sense controllers, players can enjoy a new class of games on Apple Vision Pro.1</p>
<p>“Apple Vision Pro has defined what’s possible in this new era of spatial computing, and with visionOS 26, we’re excited to push the boundaries even further,” said Mike Rockwell, Apple’s vice president of the Vision Products Group.</p>
<p>“With brand-new ways for Vision Pro owners to connect, explore, work together, and enjoy content, we’re incredibly excited for users to enjoy features like apps and widgets that they can arrange in their spaces, spatial scenes that offer a brand-new viewing experience for their photos, and dramatically enhanced Personas on Vision Pro.”</p>

<h2> Widgets Become Spatial </h2>
<p>Across the Apple ecosystem, widgets offer personalized and useful information at a glance, and with visionOS 26, widgets become spatial, integrating seamlessly into a user’s space and reappearing every time they put on Apple Vision Pro. </p>
<p>Widgets in visionOS 26 are customizable, with a variety of options for frame width, color, and depth. Beautiful new widgets — including Clock, Weather, Music, and Photos — all offer unique interactions and experiences.</p>

<p>Users can decorate their spaces with favorite widgets, including stunning panoramas and spatial photos of their favorite memories, clocks with distinctive face designs, and quick access to their go-to playlists and songs on Apple Music.</p>
<p>The Widgets app helps users find widgets, including those from compatible iOS and iPadOS apps, and developers will also be able to create their own widgets using WidgetKit.
</p>
<p>All widgets — including Calendar, shown here — are customizable, with a variety of options for frame width, color, and depth.</p>

<h2>Enhanced Shared Spatial Experiences</h2>
<p>Users love how visionOS lets them connect with family, friends, and colleagues remotely, and with visionOS 26, they can share spatial experiences with other Apple Vision Pro users in the same room.</p>
<p>They can come together to watch the latest blockbuster movie in 3D, play a spatial game, or collaborate with coworkers. </p>
<p>Users can also add remote participants from across the world via FaceTime, enabling connection with people near and far.</p>
<p>Dassault Systèmes, a leading provider of engineering and 3D design software, is leveraging this ability with their 3DLive app, bringing the ability to visualize 3D designs both in person and with remote colleagues.
</p>
<p>With visionOS 26, Personas are transformed to feel more natural and familiar. </p>
<p>Taking advantage of industry-leading volumetric rendering and machine learning technology, the all-new Personas now have striking expressivity and sharpness, offering a full side profile view, and remarkably accurate hair, lashes, and complexion.</p>
<p> Personas are still created on device in a matter of seconds, and new improvements to the setup process allow users to adjust and preview how their Persona looks spatially, and even pick glasses from over 1,000 variations.</p>
    
<h2>Introducing Spatial Scenes</h2>
<p>visionOS 26 makes spatial photos even more realistic, leveraging a new generative AI algorithm and computational depth to create spatial scenes with multiple perspectives, letting users feel like they can lean in and look around.</p>
<p>Users can view spatial scenes in the Photos app, Spatial Gallery app, and Safari, while developers can use the Spatial Scene API to make their app experience even more immersive.</p>
<p>Zillow is taking advantage of the API for their Zillow Immersive app, allowing users to see images of homes and apartments with the rich depth and dimension that spatial scenes offer.</p>

        excerpt: 'A new software design makes using Apple Watch even more delightful, Workout Buddy brings a first-of-its-kind workout experience with Apple Intelligence, and the Smart Stack and Messages are more intelligent',
        content: `<p>Apple today previewed watchOS 26, offering a beautiful new look and even more intelligence for a more personalized experience, to support users in staying active, healthy, and connected.</p>
<p>A new design with Liquid Glass makes features like the Smart Stack, Control Center, the Photos watch face, and in-app navigation and controls more expressive, while maintaining the instant familiarity of watchOS.</p>
<p>Apple Intelligence enhances the fitness experience with Workout Buddy, which provides personalized, spoken motivation. </p>
<p>The Workout app features a new layout, and offers music to listen to based on a user’s tastes and the workout type. watchOS 26 makes everyday interactions even more convenient with Smart Stack hints and updates to Messages, and introduces a new one-handed wrist flick gesture to easily dismiss notifications.</p>       
<p>“Apple Watch is an indispensable companion for millions of people around the world, and watchOS 26 uses intelligence to offer an even more personalized experience,” said David Clark, Apple’s senior director of watchOS Engineering. </p>
<p>“From a gorgeous new design, to Workout Buddy with Apple Intelligence, personalized music suggestions in the Workout app, and more intelligence in the Smart Stack and Messages, we’re excited about the many ways watchOS 26 will support each user in staying active, healthy, connected, and safe throughout their day.”</p>

<h2>A Beutiful New Design</h2>
<p>A gorgeous new software design with Liquid Glass brings a fresh look to watchOS 26. Across apps, this new design enables a vibrant and expressive experience that reflects and refracts content using real-time rendering, which brings even more focus to content and makes using Apple Watch even more delightful.</p>
<p>Smart Stack widgets, Smart Stack hints, notifications, Control Center, and in-app controls and navigation will adopt the new design. The popular Photos watch face is enhanced with numerals made of Liquid Glass, allowing users to see even more of their photo.</p>
<p>The updated Photos watch face is shown on Apple Watch.</p>
<p>The Smart Stack is shown on Apple Watch.
Updated controls in the Music app are shown on Apple Watch.</p>

<h2>Apple Intelligence Comes to Fitness with Workout Buddy</h2>
<p>Workout Buddy is a first-of-its-kind fitness experience with Apple Intelligence that incorporates a user’s workout data and their fitness history to generate personalized, motivational insights during their session, based on data like heart rate, pace, distance, Activity rings, personal fitness milestones, and more.</p>
<p>For example, as a user starts a run, Workout Buddy will give a personalized pep talk that may remind them of their running mileage for the week so far, or share how they are doing against their Activity ring goals: “Way to get out for your run this Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>You’re 18 minutes away from closing your Exercise ring. So far this week, you’ve run 6 miles. You’re going to add to that today.”</p>
<p>During the workout, Workout Buddy can mark key moments like their mile splits, or tell them if they hit a new milestone based on their fitness history: “Mile four. You picked up the pace and ran that last one in 8 minutes and 28 seconds.” “Hey, check this out. Your total running distance for the year just crossed the 200-mile mark! That’s a lot of running!”</p>
<p>When a user ends a workout, Workout Buddy will recap their workout stats and congratulate them on their achievements:</p>
<p>Way to get your workout in! You went 4.3 miles in just over 38 minutes. Your average pace was 8 minutes and 58 seconds, and your average heart rate was 128. That was your longest run of the last 28 days. What will you do next?”</p>
<p>To offer meaningful inspiration in real time, Workout Buddy analyzes data privately and securely, with Apple Intelligence. </p>
<p>A new text-to-speech model then translates insights into a dynamic generative voice built using voice data from Fitness+ trainers, so it has the right energy, style, and tone for a workout.</p>
<p>Workout Buddy will be available on Apple Watch with Bluetooth headphones, and requires an Apple Intelligence-supported iPhone nearby.</p>
<p>It will be available starting in English, across some of the most popular workout types: Outdoor and Indoor Run, Outdoor and Indoor Walk, Outdoor Cycle, HIIT, and Functional and Traditional Strength Training.</p>

<h2>Additional Updates to the Workout Experience</h2>
<p>The Workout app is one of the most popular apps on Apple Watch, and in watchOS 26, it debuts the biggest update to its layout and navigation since its introduction. </p>
<p>Four new buttons in the corners of the app make it easier for users to access their favorite features to customize workouts, like Workout Views, Custom Workout, Pacer, Race Route, and more.</p>
<p>To add inspiration, users can set up music and podcasts right in the Workout app to automatically play when they start a workout.</p>
<p>For users’ convenience, Apple Music can now select the best playlist for a user’s workout based on the workout type and their personal tastes.1 Alternatively, users can see suggestions for playlists or podcasts based on what they’ve recently listened to during that particular workout type.</p>


<h2>The Smart Stack Becomes Even More Proactive</h2>
<p>The Smart Stack is designed to help users quickly access important information from any watch face. In watchOS 26, the Smart Stack improves its prediction algorithms by incorporating more contextual data, sensor data, and data from a user’s routine to provide Smart Stack hints, a proactive prompt for actionable suggestions that are immediately useful.</p>
<p>Made of Liquid Glass, Smart Stack hints will appear on the display as a gentle visual prompt. For example, a hint for Backtrack may appear when a user is in a remote location with no connectivity, or a hint for a Pilates workout may show up when a user arrives at a studio location at their usual time.</p>

<h2>Added Convenience in Messages</h2>
<p>Apple Watch now supports Live Translation in Messages with Apple Intelligence, allowing incoming texts to be automatically translated into a user’s preferred language, right on their wrist.</p>
<p>And when the user responds, their texts can be instantly translated for the person they’re having a conversation with. Live Translation will be available on Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Series 10, and Apple Watch Ultra 2, with an Apple Intelligence-supported iPhone.</p>
<p>Additionally, for users whose device language is set to English, Apple Watch will intelligently suggest relevant actions in Messages using the context of a conversation, like starting a Check In when a friend asks a user to share when they arrive home, or using Apple Cash when a user is asked to contribute to a group gift.</p>
<p>Customizable Backgrounds set on iPhone will also appear on Apple Watch to make conversations feel more personal and distinct, and users can respond to polls right on their wrist. </p>
<p>Smart Replies get even more precise for users whose device language is set to English, with an improved on-device language model that can generate relevant responses based on the content of a conversation.3
</p>

<p>In Messages, customizable Backgrounds make conversations feel more personal and distinct. Additionally, Apple Watch will intelligently suggest relevant actions in Messages using the context of a conversation.</p>

<h2>Notifications Are Easier to Manage</h2>
<p>Notifications are even easier to manage with a simple wrist flick gesture on Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Series 10, and Apple Watch Ultra 2. </p>
<p>When a user raises their wrist to check a notification but isn’t ready to respond, they can quickly turn their wrist over and back to dismiss the notification. </p>
<p>The wrist flick gesture can be used to dismiss notifications and incoming calls, silence timers and alarms, and return to the watch face. It uses the accelerometer and the gyroscope — along with a machine learning model — to analyze a user’s wrist movement. </p>
<p>Wrist flick joins the double tap gesture to allow users to do even more on Apple Watch with only one hand, for times when the user’s other hand is occupied, such as when walking the dog, cooking, or holding a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>Notifications are now even easier to manage with a simple wrist flick gesture. When a user raises their wrist to check a notification but isn’t ready to respond, they can quickly turn their wrist over and back to dismiss the notification.</p>
<p>Apple Watch can also now automatically adjust the speaker volume based on the ambient noise in a user’s surroundings for notifications, timers, alarms, incoming calls, and Siri, allowing them to stay connected without worrying about disturbing those around them.</p>



<h2>Additional updates in watchOS 26:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The Notes app comes to Apple Watch, allowing users to access their notes right on their wrist. Users can also pin and unlock notes, complete checklist items, and create new notes with Siri, dictation, and the keyboard.</li>
    <li>Hold Assist and Call Screening come to the Phone app, when an iPhone is nearby. When a user is waiting for a live agent, Hold Assist recognizes once a live agent is available and notifies the user to return to the call.</li>
    <li>Call Screening helps users manage incoming phone calls from unknown numbers more efficiently by collecting a name and reason for the call before their phone rings, so they can make an informed decision on whether to pick up, decline the call, or ask for more information</li>
    <li>For users who are deaf or hard of hearing, Live Listen controls come to Apple Watch with a new set of features, including real-time Live Captions of what their iPhone hears on a paired Apple Watch while listening to the audio.</li>
    <li>Apple Watch serves as a remote control to start or stop Live Listen sessions on a paired iPhone, or jump back into a session to capture something that may have been missed. </li>
</ul>

<p>he Photos face will now shuffle images based on Featured content from Photos, so users can see images of their most meaningful moments every time they raise their wrist or tap the display.
Users can now explore and discover watch faces more easily with the redesigned watch face gallery on Apple Watch and in the Watch app on iPhone, with faces grouped into collections.</p>

<h2>New Tools For Developers</h2>
<p>Developers are able to take advantage of new APIs in watchOS 26 across design, the Smart Stack, and more.</p>
<p>Developers can use new SwiftUI APIs to adopt the beautiful new design materials of watchOS 26. </p>
<p>With the Control Widget API, developers can create custom controls to be added to the Control Center, Action Button, or Smart Stack widget, and the Smart Stack Relevance API allows third-party widgets to be added to the Smart Stack with new signals like Points of Interest, with user permission to incorporate location data.</p>
<p>For example, the Smart Stack can intelligently show a widget for Slopes when users arrive at a ski resort with improved location APIs, and now Dark Noise can add a custom control to Control Center so users can easily turn on a sleep soundscape without picking up their iPhone.</p>
<p>The Smart Stack is shown on a user’s Apple Watch.

        content: `<p>Although it hasn’t been built yet, this carbon-free yacht is designed as a travelling laboratory for scientists to explore the oceans and tackle today’s biggest environmental problems. With room for 22 laboratories, 160 scientists and 20 students, the yacht will be powered by a Molten Salt Reactor - a new type of nuclear power that is 100 per cent emission-free.</p>
<p>There’s room for tourists, but at a price.
Designed by superyacht expert Ivan Salas Jefferson, the Earth 300 will also have room for 40 VIP guests who will pay a whopping $3 million (€2.5 million) for the pleasure of staying aboard the vessel. Scientists and students will either travel for free or at a reduced rate.</p>
<p>The Earth 300 will be the biggest of the lot though, at 300 metres in length and 60 metres in height. That’s 31m longer than the Titanic.
"Earth 300 will use global systems thinking, aboard the vessel we will explore the broadest spectrum of standpoints, bringing together the smartest and brightest minds to create an intelligence collective that is unrivalled in scope and diversity,” says Oliveria.</p>
<p>
“It will hold 4 different communities - scientists, experts, students and private citizens.” It is this mix of citizens and scientists that the team hopes will produce radical new thinking in the fight against climate change.</p>
<h2>Earth 300</h2>

<p>The yacht will eventually be powered by a Molten Salt reactor.Earth 300
Is the technology ready yet?
While the design of the Earth 300 is a futuristic one, much of the technology required has not come to market yet. Initially, the yacht will be powered by green fuels, as the Molten Salt Reactor is still in development. The reactor is being developed by Terrapower, a company backed by Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates.

<p>The system supports both dynamic charging (while vehicles are moving) and static charging (when vehicles are parked).</p>
<p>The main goal of this initiative is to improve the efficiency and eco-friendliness of public transport. Electric buses can now charge while they are operating, which eliminates the need for frequent charging stops. This enhancement boosts operational efficiency and helps reduce carbon emissions, aligning with Norway’s goal of achieving a zero-emission transport sector by 2025.</p>
<p>The pilot phase of the project began in June 2023 and will involve about a year of testing. During this time, three electric buses from Chinese manufacturers Yutong and Higer will be evaluated under Trondheim’s real-world conditions, including its harsh winter weather.
</p>
<p>The Norwegian government is funding the project with an estimated budget of 22.4 million Norwegian kroner (around $2.12 million USD).</p>
<p>This initiative involves collaboration between various partners, including Electreon Wireless and the Chinese bus makers, highlighting the importance of teamwork in driving innovation.</p>
<p>If the pilot project proves successful, it could lead to the broader adoption of wireless charging roads across Norway and potentially inspire similar projects worldwide. </p>
<p>The long-term vision includes establishing a comprehensive Electric Road System in Trondheim that would serve various types of vehicles, including buses, electric trucks, and taxis.</p>`,
